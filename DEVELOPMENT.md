## Available Scripts (typical Vite)
- `npm run dev` — Start dev server
- `npm run build` — Build for production
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build

## State & Logic (guidance)
- Use React `useState` / `useReducer`; keep all state in memory
- `useValidation.js`: ensure no blanks; mafia < players; show errors/confirmations
- `useAllocation.js`: build roles list by mafia count, Fisher–Yates shuffle, map to players
- `useRevealFlow.js`: index-based enforcement of reveal order; guard against multiple open dialogs

## Testing Checklist (minimum)
- [ ] Happy path: e.g., 8 players, 2 mafia → allocate → reveal sequentially → reset
- [ ] Validation: block blanks; prevent mafia ≥ players; allow duplicates
- [ ] Re-allocation: clicking again reshuffles roles
- [ ] Reveal flow: single dialog; role persists after reveal; close then pass device
- [ ] Reset: returns to inputs; names retained; allocations cleared
- [ ] Performance: quick load and responsive taps on mobile

## 📋 **Architectural Decisions Log**

### Tailwind CSS Integration (September 28, 2025)
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 implemented** with PostCSS and Autoprefixer integration
- **Configuration**: Mobile-first breakpoints (sm:640px, md:768px, lg:1024px)
- **Performance**: CSS bundle optimized to 6.16KB (87.7% under 50KB target)
- **Architecture**: Utility-first styling replacing custom CSS files
- **Technical decisions**:
  - Replaced `src/App.css` with Tailwind utility classes in React components
  - Added `src/index.css` with @tailwind directives (base, components, utilities)
  - Configured `tailwind.config.js` with content paths for CSS purging
  - Established `postcss.config.js` with tailwindcss and autoprefixer plugins
- **Impact**: Provides consistent, mobile-optimized styling foundation for all future components
- **Dependencies**: tailwindcss@3.4.17, postcss@8.5.6, autoprefixer@10.4.21

### Player Count Management Bug Fix (September 29, 2025)
- ✅ **Dynamic field generation bug resolved** in `usePlayerCountManager` hook
- **Issue**: Array expansion logic failed when increasing player count after decreasing (e.g., 1→2 players)
- **Root cause**: Using `array.length = count` for expansion creates undefined slots instead of proper array elements
- **Solution**: Implemented explicit expansion logic with `while` loop and `push('')` for new slots
- **Technical changes**:
  - Modified `updatePlayerCount` function in `src/hooks/usePlayerCountManager.js`
  - Replaced `newNames.length = count` with conditional expansion/truncation logic
  - Ensured all array positions contain string values (empty or filled)
- **Testing**: Verified 1→2, 1→5, 5→2 player count transitions work correctly
- **Impact**: Resolves critical UX issue ensuring dynamic name fields appear correctly for all count changes
- **Commit**: `ea1d8c5` on branch `copilot/fix-f5bd74f4-9954-48c6-91fd-fff2ad648c27`

### Player Name Input System Enhancement (September 29, 2025)

  - **Enhanced accessibility**: Proper ARIA compliance with role="alert" and field-specific error messages, screen reader announcements
  - **Whitespace handling**: Spaces-only names properly treated as invalid using `trim()` validation
- **Technical implementation**:
  - Modified `src/hooks/usePlayerCountManager.js`: Added touchedFields state, enhanced validation object structure, improved error messaging
  - Enhanced `src/components/PlayerCountManager.jsx`: Rich UI components with progress indicators, field-level validation feedback, global validation summary
  - **Backward compatibility**: All existing API contracts maintained, props interface unchanged, integration points preserved
- **Performance impact**: +2.35KB JS (+28%), +1.49KB CSS (+12%) - within performance budgets
- **Testing completed**: Comprehensive validation of enhanced features, visual feedback, accessibility compliance, mobile optimization

## Project Automation
- GitHub Actions workflow added for automated issue creation:
  - Location: `.github/workflows/create-feature-issues.yml`
  - Usage: Run manually from GitHub → Actions → "Create Feature Issues" → Provide inputs:
    - `feature_name` (required)
    - `epic_issue` (required number)
    - `docs_path` (optional docs folder path; e.g., `docs/ways-of-work/plan/<epic>/<feature>`)
  - Outcome: Creates a Feature issue (inherits Epic milestone if available). If `docs_path` is provided, the issue includes a Docs section that auto-links PRD.md, implementation-plan.md, project-plan.md, and issues-checklist.md when present (case-insensitive). The workflow is intentionally simplified; it no longer auto-creates child issues or comments on the Epic.
