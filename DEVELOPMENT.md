## Tech Stack
- React 18 (functional components + Hooks)
- Vite (dev server + build pipeline)
- Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 (strictly v3)
- JavaScript only (no TypeScript)
- Frontend-only; no backend; no analytics; no persistence

## Development Phases (from PRD)

### Phase 1: Setup & Project Scaffolding ✅ **Feature PRDs COMPLETE** | 🚀 **IN PROGRESS**
**Feature Breakdown** (each can be developed independently):
- ✅ **Vite React Initialization** **COMPLETE** - Core React 18 + Vite foundation implemented with mobile-first architecture  
- ✅ **Tailwind Integration** **COMPLETE** - CSS framework v3.4.17 integrated with mobile-first configuration, PostCSS, and production purging (6.16KB bundle)
- [ ] **Development Tooling** - ESLint, Prettier, npm scripts, code quality enforcement
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization** - Viewport configuration, performance budgets, mobile patterns

### Phase 2: Input & Validation ✅ **Feature PRDs COMPLETE**
**Feature Breakdown** (each can be developed independently):
- [ ] **Player Count Management** - Dynamic field generation based on player count input
- [ ] **Mafia Count Validation** - Ratio validation preventing impossible game configurations
- [ ] **Player Name Input System** - Name collection with blank prevention and duplicate support

### Phase 3: Role Allocation ✅ **Feature PRDs COMPLETE** 
**Feature Breakdown** (each can be developed independently):
- [ ] **Allocation Confirmation Flow** - Confirmation gateway with parameter display before allocation
- [ ] **Role Assignment Engine** - Fisher-Yates shuffle with mathematically fair randomization
- [ ] **Re-allocation System** - Independent reshuffling with complete state cleanup

### Phase 4: Role Display & Reveal ✅ **Feature PRDs COMPLETE**
**Feature Breakdown** (each can be developed independently):
- [ ] **Card List Interface** - Organized player display with mobile-optimized layout
- [ ] **Role Reveal Dialog** - Private role viewing with secure reveal/close workflow
- [ ] **Sequential Order Enforcement** - Strict order control with prominent current player cue

### Phase 5: Reset / Re-Allocate ✅ **Feature PRDs COMPLETE**
**Feature Breakdown** (each can be developed independently):
- [ ] **Reset Button System** - State cleanup returning to input with name preservation

### Phase 6: Minimal Styling & UI Clarity ✅ **Feature PRDs COMPLETE**
**Feature Breakdown** (each can be developed independently):
- [ ] **Visual Differentiation System** - Clear element styling using Tailwind utilities
- [ ] **Mobile Layout Optimization** - Touch-friendly responsive design patterns

### Phase 7: Alternative & Edge Cases ✅ **Feature PRDs COMPLETE**
**Feature Breakdown** (each can be developed independently):
- [ ] **Edge Case Validation** - 0/all Mafia handling with appropriate confirmations
- [ ] **Error Recovery System** - Double-tap protection and workflow continuity

### Phase 7: Testing & QA
- [ ] Manual test full workflow on mobile
- [ ] Validate edge cases (0/all mafia, double-tap)
- [ ] Verify performance budgets (load <2s, tap <200ms)

## Available Scripts (typical Vite)
- `npm run dev` — Start dev server
- `npm run build` — Build for production
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build

## State & Logic (guidance)
- Use React `useState` / `useReducer`; keep all state in memory
- `useValidation.js`: ensure no blanks; mafia < players; show errors/confirmations
- `useAllocation.js`: build roles list by mafia count, Fisher–Yates shuffle, map to players
- `useRevealFlow.js`: index-based enforcement of reveal order; guard against multiple open dialogs

## Testing Checklist (minimum)
- [ ] Happy path: e.g., 8 players, 2 mafia → allocate → reveal sequentially → reset
- [ ] Validation: block blanks; prevent mafia ≥ players; allow duplicates
- [ ] Re-allocation: clicking again reshuffles roles
- [ ] Reveal flow: single dialog; role persists after reveal; close then pass device
- [ ] Reset: returns to inputs; names retained; allocations cleared
- [ ] Performance: quick load and responsive taps on mobile

## Contributing
- Follow `copilot-instructions.md` for documentation updates and acceptance criteria
- Keep terminology consistent with UI ("Allocate Roles", "Reset", etc.)
 - Prompt library:
   - `.github/prompts/breakdown-feature-implementation.prompt.md` — implementation plans
   - `.github/prompts/breakdown-plan.prompt.md` — project plans & issues checklists
   - `.github/prompts/generate-issue-bodies.prompt.md` — Epic/Feature issue bodies (paste-ready) from a single `file_path`; scans same directory for sibling docs

## 📋 **Architectural Decisions Log**

### Tailwind CSS Integration (October 8, 2025)
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 implemented** with PostCSS and Autoprefixer integration
- **Configuration**: Mobile-first breakpoints (sm:640px, md:768px, lg:1024px)
- **Performance**: CSS bundle optimized to 6.16KB (87.7% under 50KB target)
- **Architecture**: Utility-first styling replacing custom CSS files
- **Technical decisions**:
  - Replaced `src/App.css` with Tailwind utility classes in React components
  - Added `src/index.css` with @tailwind directives (base, components, utilities)
  - Configured `tailwind.config.js` with content paths for CSS purging
  - Established `postcss.config.js` with tailwindcss and autoprefixer plugins
- **Impact**: Provides consistent, mobile-optimized styling foundation for all future components
- **Dependencies**: tailwindcss@3.4.17, postcss@8.5.6, autoprefixer@10.4.21

## Project Automation
- GitHub Actions workflow added for automated issue creation:
  - Location: `.github/workflows/create-feature-issues.yml`
  - Usage: Run manually from GitHub → Actions → "Create Feature Issues" → Provide inputs:
    - `feature_name` (required)
    - `epic_issue` (required number)
    - `docs_path` (optional docs folder path; e.g., `docs/ways-of-work/plan/<epic>/<feature>`)
  - Outcome: Creates a Feature issue (inherits Epic milestone if available). If `docs_path` is provided, the issue includes a Docs section that auto-links PRD.md, implementation-plan.md, project-plan.md, and issues-checklist.md when present (case-insensitive). The workflow is intentionally simplified; it no longer auto-creates child issues or comments on the Epic.
