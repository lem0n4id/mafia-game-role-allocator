   - Configured `safe-area-inset-top/bottom/left/right` utilities
   - Enables proper padding on iPhone X+ and modern Android devices

3. **Comprehensive Testing Documentation**
   - Created `dev-tools/mobile-layout-test.md` with test scenarios
   - Documented all acceptance criteria verification steps
   - Included static checks and dynamic testing methodology

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### ✅ AC-1: Responsive Layout (320px-768px)

**Requirements:**
- Layout works correctly on screens 320px-768px width
- Portrait orientation is optimized and preferred
- Content scales appropriately without horizontal scrolling
- Viewport configuration prevents unwanted zooming

**Verification:**
- ✅ Tested at 320px (iPhone SE) - Layout perfect, no horizontal scroll
- ✅ Tested at 375px (iPhone X/12/13) - Optimal mobile experience
- ✅ Tested at 414px (iPhone Plus) - Comfortable viewing
- ✅ Tested at 768px (iPad Mini) - Tablet optimized with md: breakpoint
- ✅ Viewport meta configured: `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover`
- ✅ Mobile-first breakpoints: base (0px), sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px)

**Screenshot Evidence:**
- 320px: Shows proper layout with no overflow
- 375px: Optimal mobile experience with sticky cue visible
- 375px scrolled: Demonstrates sticky positioning working

### ✅ AC-2: Touch Optimization

**Requirements:**
- All interactive elements meet 44px minimum touch target
- Touch targets have appropriate spacing to prevent accidents
- Buttons and cards respond immediately to touch
- Interface works reliably with finger interaction

**Verification:**
- ✅ Player count input: h-12 (48px)
- ✅ Mafia count input: h-12 (48px)
- ✅ Player name inputs: h-12 (48px)
- ✅ Allocate Roles button: h-14 (56px)
- ✅ Reset button: h-12 (48px)
- ✅ Reveal Role button: h-14 (56px)
- ✅ Close button: h-12 (48px)
- ✅ Player cards: min-h-[72px] (72px)

**Spacing Verification:**
- ✅ Card spacing: space-y-3 (12px between cards)
- ✅ Button spacing: space-y-3 (12px between buttons)
- ✅ Section spacing: space-y-6 (24px between sections)
- ✅ Component spacing: space-y-4 (16px between components)
- ✅ Touch-manipulation CSS applied to all interactive elements

### ✅ AC-3: Current Player Cue Visibility

**Requirements:**
- Current player name always visible at screen top
- Cue remains visible during scrolling
- Cue styling is prominent and attention-grabbing
- Cue updates smoothly as players progress

**Verification:**
- ✅ Sticky positioning: `sticky top-0 z-10` applied
- ✅ Remains visible during scroll (verified with screenshots)
- ✅ Backdrop blur for visibility: `backdrop-blur-sm bg-opacity-95`
- ✅ Enhanced shadow: `shadow-lg` for depth perception
- ✅ Prominent border: `border-2 border-blue-500`
- ✅ Animated pulse indicator: `w-3 h-3 animate-pulse`
- ✅ Bold text: `font-bold text-blue-900`
- ✅ Position counter: "1 of 5" badge visible
- ✅ ARIA live region: `role="status" aria-live="polite"`
- ✅ Text truncation: `truncate` for long names
- ✅ Responsive flex layout with proper overflow handling

**Visual Evidence:**
Screenshot at 375px width shows:
1. Blue current player indicator at top with "Next: Alice" and "1 of 5"
2. Animated pulse dot visible
3. Instruction text "Tap card below to reveal role"
4. Proper styling with backdrop blur and shadow
5. Cards below with proper spacing

Screenshot after scrolling shows:
1. Current player cue remains at top (sticky positioning working)
2. Cards scrolled underneath the cue
3. No overlap or visual issues
4. Backdrop blur provides visibility over content

Screenshot at 320px shows:
1. Layout adapts perfectly to smallest viewport
2. Text truncates properly for constrained space
3. All elements remain accessible
4. No horizontal scrolling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Sticky Positioning Pattern

```jsx
// Current player indicator with sticky positioning
<div 
  className="sticky top-0 z-10 -mx-4 px-4 py-3 
             bg-blue-50 border-2 border-blue-500 rounded-lg 
             shadow-lg backdrop-blur-sm bg-opacity-95"
  role="status"
  aria-live="polite"
>
  {/* Content with flex layout and text truncation */}
</div>
```

**Key Techniques:**
1. `sticky top-0` - Sticks to top during scroll
2. `z-10` - Layers above content
3. `-mx-4 px-4` - Extends to container edges (compensates for parent padding)
4. `backdrop-blur-sm bg-opacity-95` - Visibility over scrolling content
5. `shadow-lg` - Depth perception
6. `truncate` on text - Handles overflow
7. `min-w-0 flex-1` - Proper flex text truncation

### Safe Area Inset Configuration

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
theme: {
  extend: {
    spacing: {
      'safe-top': 'env(safe-area-inset-top)',
      'safe-bottom': 'env(safe-area-inset-bottom)',
      'safe-left': 'env(safe-area-inset-left)',
      'safe-right': 'env(safe-area-inset-right)',
    },
  },
}
```

**Usage:** `pt-safe-top`, `pb-safe-bottom`, etc.
