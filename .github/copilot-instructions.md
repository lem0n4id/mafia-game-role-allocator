# Mafia Game Role Allocator ‚Äî Copilot Development Instructions

## üö® **MANDATORY: DOCUMENTATION UPDATE PROTOCOL** üö®

### **‚ö†Ô∏è STOP: Read This Before Making ANY Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**EVERY architectural change MUST include documentation updates. No exceptions.**

#### **üî• IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED After ANY Code Change:**

**Before considering your work "complete", you MUST complete this checklist:**

‚úÖ **1. UPDATE copilot-instructions.md (THIS FILE):**
   - [ ] Update "Current Architecture Status" section (lines 150-200)
   - [ ] Update relevant code patterns and examples  
   - [ ] Update file structure if files were added/moved
   - [ ] Update component patterns if new patterns introduced
   - [ ] Add new development guidelines if applicable

‚úÖ **2. UPDATE DEVELOPMENT.md:**
   - [ ] Mark completed steps with ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** status
   - [ ] Update current phase/step status
   - [ ] Add new architectural decisions to the log
   - [ ] Update timeline estimates and next steps
   - [ ] Document any breaking changes or migration steps

‚úÖ **3. VALIDATE DOCUMENTATION CONSISTENCY:**
   - [ ] Search for outdated patterns that conflict with changes
   - [ ] Remove or update deprecated examples
   - [ ] Verify all code examples reflect current architecture
   - [ ] Update import statements and API references

‚úÖ **4. TEST DOCUMENTATION ACCURACY:**
   - [ ] Ensure new contributors could follow the updated docs
   - [ ] Verify code examples compile and work
   - [ ] Check that docs reflect actual codebase state
   - [ ] Test that documented patterns match implemented code

### **üéØ Documentation Update Triggers (NEVER SKIP):**
- ‚úÖ Creating new hooks, components, or utilities
- ‚úÖ Modifying existing architectural patterns  
- ‚úÖ Completing any refactoring step or phase
- ‚úÖ Adding new development tools or workflows
- ‚úÖ Changing file structure or organization
- ‚úÖ Introducing new performance optimizations
- ‚úÖ Adding new state management patterns

### **üí• ENFORCEMENT: If Documentation Is Not Updated**
- **Your changes are incomplete** - Documentation debt creates confusion
- **Future developers will be misled** - Outdated docs are worse than no docs
- **Architecture will deteriorate** - Patterns won't be followed consistently
- **Project velocity will slow** - Time wasted on confusion and rework

### **üé™ Quick Documentation Health Check:**
Before submitting any architectural change, ask yourself:
- ‚ùì Could a new team member understand the current architecture from the docs?
- ‚ùì Do all code examples in copilot-instructions.md work with current code?
- ‚ùì Does DEVELOPMENT.md accurately reflect what's been completed?
- ‚ùì Are there conflicting patterns or outdated instructions anywhere?

## Project Context
- Mobile-only, portrait layout, minimal and lightweight web app
- Frontend only; no backend; no analytics; no persistence
- Roles: Mafia vs Villagers only (no advanced roles)
- Core flows: Input & Validation ‚Üí Allocation (with confirmation) ‚Üí Sequential Reveal ‚Üí Reset/Re-Allocate

## üö® **CRITICAL: UI Styling Requirements**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è TAILWIND CSS VERSION REQUIREMENT**
**NEVER upgrade to Tailwind CSS v4+ without extensive testing!**

- ‚úÖ **Required**: Tailwind CSS v3.4.0 or compatible v3.x version
- ‚ùå **Incompatible**: Tailwind CSS v4.x+ 

---

### **PostCSS Configuration (CRITICAL)**
**File**: `postcss.config.js`
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT (Tailwind v3):
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}

// ‚ùå WRONG (Tailwind v4 - DO NOT USE):
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {}, // This breaks shadcn
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

## Code Organization Principles

### Component Architecture
**Follow the simplified component pattern:**
[UPDATE THIS WHEN ENCOUNTERED]

### **üìã File Organization Checklist**

Before creating any new file, ask:
- [ ] Is this a core project file? ‚Üí Root directory (rare)
- [ ] Is this documentation? ‚Üí `docs/` directory
- [ ] Is this a test or development tool? ‚Üí `dev-tools/` directory  
- [ ] Is this application source code? ‚Üí `src/` directory
- [ ] Does the file follow established naming conventions?
- [ ] Is there a README in the target directory explaining its purpose?

### **üîß Maintenance Guidelines**

**Regular cleanup (monthly):**
- [ ] Review `dev-tools/` for obsolete test files
- [ ] Update `docs/README.md` when adding new documentation
- [ ] Ensure root directory remains clean and essential-only
- [ ] Verify all directories have explanatory README files

**Documentation organization:**
- [ ] Group related docs by feature or phase
- [ ] Use consistent naming: `FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `PHASE_X_PLAN.md`
- [ ] Link between related documents
- [ ] Keep navigation clear in `docs/README.md`

## Development Workflow

**üö® DOCUMENTATION-FIRST WORKFLOW - Follow This Sequence:**

1. **Build common components** - Create basic UI components  
2. **Create stores** - Set up state management
3. **Assemble features** - Create complex functional components
4. **Test integration** - Ensure components work together
5. **Optimize performance** - Profile and optimize bottlenecks
6. **üìã UPDATE DOCUMENTATION** - Complete the mandatory protocol checklist above

**‚ö†Ô∏è Your work is NOT complete until step 6 is done!**

## Code Quality Standards

- Use ESLint + Prettier for consistent formatting
- Prefer explicit over implicit code
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Prefer immutable updates over mutations
- Use semantic commit messages
- **Use Tailwind CSS v3.x only** - Do not upgrade to v4+ without compatibility testing
- **Scope custom CSS** - Avoid universal selectors

## Commit Message Guidelines

**Do NOT include tool references (e.g., #get_changed_files) in commit messages.**
Commit messages should be clear, concise, and describe the change in natural language only.

Example:
```
feat: init commit

Initial commit. Project setup for Mafia Game Role Allocator. Includes PRD.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, README.md, and copilot-instructions.md.
```

### Documentation Review Triggers:
- ‚úÖ **After completing any refactoring step**
- ‚úÖ **When changing component architecture** 
- ‚úÖ **When adding new patterns or conventions**
- ‚úÖ **When major file structure changes**
- ‚úÖ **Before marking any phase as complete**

## Tech & Tooling Requirements
- React 18 (functional components + Hooks)
- Vite (Node.js 20, npm)
- JavaScript only (no TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 strictly (do not upgrade to v4)
- State: useState/useReducer for in-memory session state
- No external tracking/analytics; no backend calls; no persistent storage

Tailwind guidance:
- Keep CSS minimal; prefer utilities
- Avoid global selectors that can degrade mobile button UI (e.g., `* {}`)
- Ensure viewport meta and touch-friendly sizes

Performance budgets (PRD):
- Load < 2s on mobile
- Interaction latency (buttons, reveal) < 200ms
- JS bundle < 500KB

---


## Product Behavior Requirements (enforce in code)
Input & Validation
- Dynamic name fields follow player count changes; deleting fields drops values
- Disallow submission with any blank name
- Allow duplicate names
- Block invalid mafia counts (mafia >= players); show error/confirmation

Role Allocation
- "Allocate Roles" triggers confirmation before shuffling
- Assign exactly `mafiaCount` Mafia; others Villagers
- Re-click reshuffles all roles (no previous allocation preserved)

Role Display & Reveal
- Show vertical list of cards
- Only one reveal dialog open at a time
- Enforce strict reveal order; show current player cue at top at all times
- "Reveal Role" ‚Üí show role ‚Üí button changes to "Close"
- Role remains visible after reveal (no hide)

Reset / Re-Allocate
- Show Reset button after allocation
- Reset returns to input screen, keeps names prefilled, clears allocations

Edge Cases & UX
- Allow mafia = 0 or mafia = players (warn/confirm)
- Double-taps on buttons must be idempotent (debounce/guards)
- Reset allowed during reveal; clears allocations and returns to input with names kept

---

## Coding Guidelines
- Use controlled inputs for all fields
- Confirmations: native confirm() or a simple modal; block actions until confirmed
- Idempotency: guard against rapid double-clicks (disable button while processing)
- Dialog accessibility: focus trap, Escape to close, return focus to trigger
- Mobile touch targets: 44px minimum touch area for buttons
- Keep state in memory only; never write to localStorage or network

Randomization
- Use Fisher‚ÄìYates shuffle; avoid biased shuffles
- Derive role list (mafiaCount true flags + villagers) and shuffle assignments

Testing (minimum)
- Happy path: 8 players, 2 mafia ‚Üí allocate ‚Üí reveal sequentially ‚Üí reset
- Edge: mafia = 0 and mafia = players (confirm and proceed)
- Validation: blank names blocked; mafia >= players blocked
- Re-allocation: roles reshuffle when clicked again
- Double-tap: reveal/close/allocate/reset remains consistent
- Performance: quick load and responsive taps on mobile

---

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping (Quick Reference)
- Inputs: dynamic fields; blank names blocked; duplicates allowed; mafia < players
- Allocation: confirmation; correct counts; reshuffle on repeat
- Reveal: single dialog; strict order; current player cue; role persists
- Reset: returns to inputs; names retained; allocations cleared
- Performance: load < 2s; interactions < 200ms; bundle < 500KB

---

## Non-Goals (Must Not Implement)
- Advanced roles (Doctor, Detective, etc.)
- Chat, timers, voting, or scoring mechanics
- Persistence (localStorage, backend), analytics, or user accounts
- Heavy UI libraries or complex styling systems

---

## Quick Start (for contributors)
- Install Node.js 20; npm install
- Run dev server; open on mobile viewport; verify flows against Acceptance Criteria
- If you change behavior, update PRD.md and this file accordingly
