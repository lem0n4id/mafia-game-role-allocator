# Summary

This session documents how we evolved the Mafia Game Role Allocator from high-level PRD to actionable epics, architecture specs, feature PRDs, and supporting automation. Key outcomes:

- Authored epic PRDs across phases (Setup, Input & Validation, Role Allocation, Role Display & Reveal, Reset/Re-Allocate, Minimal Styling, Alternative/Edge Cases)
- Produced matching architecture specs for every epic using a standardized prompt
- Broke epics into 18 independent features with complete PRDs and acceptance criteria
- Added a GitHub Action to create Feature issues and auto-link planning docs via an optional docs_path
- Created a single-input prompt to generate strict Epic/Feature issue bodies from planning docs
- Initiated a documentation sweep targeting React version consistency (with reverts for staged review)

What this illustrates: documentation-first workflow, automation to reduce friction, and iterative refinement driven by real errors (e.g., workflow 404) and feedback.

# Conversation Case Study: Generating Epics and Architecture Specs for Mafia Game Role Allocator

## Chat history

lem0n4id: Follow instructions in [breakdown-epic-pm.prompt.md](file:///c%3A/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator/.github/prompts/breakdown-epic-pm.prompt.md).
based on #file:PRD.md  , generate an epic for phase 1 Setup & Project Scaffolding

GitHub Copilot: I need to first read the breakdown-epic-pm.prompt.md file to understand the instructions for generating an epic, then create the Phase 1 epic based on the PRD. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator/.github/prompts/breakdown-epic-pm.prompt.md)

Now I understand the structure needed. Let me create an epic PRD for Phase 1: Setup & Project Scaffolding based on the information from the main PRD.

Perfect! The epic PRD I created aligns well with the main PRD requirements. Let me mark the validation as complete: 

Completed (3/3) *Review and validate epic content*

## ✅ Epic PRD Generation Complete

I've successfully created a comprehensive Epic PRD for **Phase 1: Setup & Project Scaffolding** following the instructions from the breakdown-epic-pm.prompt.md file. 

### 📊 **What Was Created**

**File Location:** epic.md

The epic PRD includes:

1. **Clear Epic Definition:** Setup & Project Scaffolding with specific problem/solution/impact analysis
2. **User Personas:** Development team and future contributors  
3. **Detailed Requirements:** Both functional (React 18, Vite, Tailwind v3.4.17) and non-functional (performance, mobile optimization)
4. **Success Metrics:** Technical KPIs including setup time, build performance, and bundle size targets
5. **Scope Management:** Clear out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep
6. **Business Value Assessment:** High value with ROI justification

### 🎯 **Key Highlights**

- **Aligns with Main PRD:** Matches all tech stack requirements (React 18, Vite, Tailwind v3.4.17, Node.js 20)
- **Mobile-First Focus:** Emphasizes mobile performance requirements (<2s load, <500KB bundle)
- **Critical Path Recognition:** Positions this epic as essential foundation for all subsequent development
- **Risk Mitigation:** Addresses configuration risks and technical debt prevention
- **Developer Experience:** Focuses on fast setup and productive development environment

The epic is now ready to be used as input for generating technical architecture specifications and implementation plans for Phase 1 of the Mafia Game Role Allocator project.

Completed (4/5) *Update copilot-instructions.md*

## ✅ Input & Validation Architecture Specification - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### 📊 Changes Made
- Created arch.md with comprehensive architecture specification
- Adapted the standard prompt template to fit the project's React-only, no-backend constraints
- Designed hook-based validation architecture with custom React patterns
- Updated documentation files to maintain consistency per enforcement protocol

### 📋 Architecture Highlights
- **React Hook Architecture**: Custom hooks (useFormState, useValidation, useDynamicFields) for modular validation
- **Mobile-First Design**: Touch-optimized inputs with real-time validation feedback
- **Dynamic Field Management**: Player count changes dynamically add/remove name inputs with value preservation
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure React validation without external libraries, keeping bundle lightweight
- **Mermaid Diagram**: Clear visualization of component, hook, validation, and state layers

### 🎯 Key Technical Decisions

GitHub Copilot: I'll break down the Setup & Project Scaffolding epic into multiple focused features and create individual PRDs for each. Let me analyze the epic and identify the logical feature boundaries. 

Created 7 todos

Based on the Setup & Project Scaffolding epic, I can identify 4 distinct features that can be developed independently:

1. **Vite React Project Initialization** - Core project setup with React 18 and basic structure
2. **Tailwind CSS Integration** - Styling system setup with v3.4.17 and mobile-first configuration  
3. **Development Tooling Setup** - ESLint, Prettier, npm scripts, and developer experience
4. **Mobile Optimization Configuration** - Viewport, performance settings, and mobile-specific optimizations

### 🎯 **Ready for Next Steps**
The Setup & Project Scaffolding epic is now ready for parallel development! Each feature can be implemented independently:

1. **Developers can pick any feature** - Each PRD is self-contained with complete requirements
2. **Parallel implementation possible** - Features have minimal dependencies on each other  
3. **Clear acceptance criteria** - Each feature has detailed validation checkboxes
4. **Consistent with epic architecture** - All features align with the high-level technical approach

**Next logical step**: Begin implementing any of the four features, starting with **Vite React Initialization** as the foundation, or proceed to break down additional epics into features.

**All documentation requirements satisfied - implementation truly complete!** 🚀

do the same for all other epics in #file:plan with their appreproate user stories that are already defined in #file:PRD.md 

Input & Validation US 1-8 from root main prd
Role Allocation US 9-12 from root main prd
Role Display & Reveal US 13-18 from root main prd
Reset / Re-Allocate US 19-21 from root main prd
Minimal Styling / UI Clarity US 22-24 from root main prd
Input & Validation US 25-30 from root main prd

GitHub Copilot: I'll break down all the remaining epics into features using the feature PRD template. Let me start by creating a comprehensive plan and then implement the feature breakdowns for each epic. 

Created 7 todos

Let me start with the first epic - Input & Validation, and work through them systematically. 

Starting (1/7) *Break down Input & Validation epic*

Let me first read the Input & Validation epic to understand the features to break down: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator/docs/ways-of-work/plan/input-and-validation/epic.md#1-1), lines 1 to 50

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator/docs/ways-of-work/plan/input-and-validation/epic.md#50-50), lines 50 to 75

Now I'll analyze the user stories US 1-8 from the PRD to understand what features to create. Based on the epic and user stories, I can identify these features for Input & Validation:

1. **Player Count Management** (US 1, 3, 4) - Dynamic field generation
2. **Mafia Count Validation** (US 2, 8) - Mafia count input with validation  
3. **Player Name Input System** (US 5, 6, 7) - Name field management and validation

Let me create the feature PRDs: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator/docs/ways-of-work/plan/input-and-validation/player-count-management)

Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator/docs/ways-of-work/plan/input-and-validation/player-name-input-system/prd.md)

Now let me mark the Input & Validation epic as complete and move to Role Allocation: 

Starting (2/7) *Break down Role Allocation epic*

Now let me analyze Role Allocation (US 9-12) and break it down: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator/docs/ways-of-work/plan/role-allocation/epic.md#1-1), lines 1 to 50

Based on US 9-12, I can identify these features for Role Allocation:

1. **Allocation Confirmation Flow** (US 9, 10) - Confirmation prompt and triggering
2. **Role Assignment Engine** (US 11) - Randomization and role distribution  
3. **Re-allocation System** (US 12) - Reshuffling and state management

Now let me continue with Role Display & Reveal (US 13-18): 

Starting (3/7) *Break down Role Display & Reveal epic*

Based on US 13-18, I can identify these features for Role Display & Reveal:

1. **Card List Interface** (US 13, 14) - Card display and layout  
2. **Role Reveal Dialog** (US 16, 17, 18) - Individual role reveal mechanics
3. **Sequential Order Enforcement** (US 15, 24) - Order control and player cue

Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator/docs/ways-of-work/plan/role-display-and-reveal/sequential-order-enforcement)

Due to length constraints, let me create the Role Display & Reveal feature PRDs and then move to complete the remaining epics more efficiently: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator/docs/ways-of-work/plan/role-display-and-reveal/card-list-interface/prd.md)

Now let me create the remaining PRDs more efficiently. Let me continue with the remaining epics quickly:

## Files added (high level)
For each feature:
- `project-plan.md` — Overview, hierarchy diagram, issues breakdown, priority/value, estimation, dependencies diagram, board config.
- `issues-checklist.md` — Prepared checklists for creating Epic/Feature/Story/Enabler/Test issues, acceptance criteria, and DoD.

Examples:
- project-plan.md
- issues-checklist.md
- ... and the same pair for each of the other 17 features.

## Commit summary
- Commit: docs(plan): add project plans and issue checklists for all features
- Includes:
  - New planning docs across all 18 features
  - Docs updates to DEVELOPMENT.md and copilot-instructions.md
- Result: Planning artifacts ready for GitHub project issue creation and dependency mapping.

## Status and next steps

Added 1 todo

Ran terminal command: cd /c/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator && git add .github/workflows/create-feature-issues.yml .github/copilot-instructions.md DEVELOPMENT.md && git commit -m "chore(actions): add Create Feature Issues workflow\n\nAdd reusable workflow to create Feature issues with labels and docs links,\noptionally generating User Stories, Enablers, and Tests as child issues.\n\n- inputs: epic_issue, feature_name, feature_path, priority, value, labels\n- flags: create_children with stories/enablers/tests lists\n- comments: links back to Epic and Feature for traceability\n\nDocs: Updated DEVELOPMENT.md and copilot-instructions.md with usage and details."

I’ve added an automated GitHub Actions workflow to create Feature issues (and optional child issues), updated the docs, and committed everything.

## Actions taken

- Added workflow: create-feature-issues.yml
  - Triggers manually (workflow_dispatch)
  - Inputs:
    - epic_issue (required), feature_name (required)
    - feature_path (optional path to docs)
    - priority: critical|high|medium|low
    - value: high|medium|low
    - labels: comma-separated extra labels
    - create_children: boolean
    - stories, enablers, tests: newline-separated lists for child issues
  - Behavior:
    - Creates a Feature issue with labels and links to docs if `feature_path` provided
    - Comments on the Epic linking the Feature
    - Optionally creates User Story, Enabler, and Test issues; comments on both Epic and Feature with child issue links
    - Ensures traceability

- Updated docs
  - DEVELOPMENT.md: Added “Project Automation” section with workflow usage
  - copilot-instructions.md: Added “Project Automation (Actions)” section and reminder in “Documentation Review Triggers”

- Committed changes
  - Commit: chore(actions): add Create Feature Issues workflow
  - Files: workflow + updated docs

## How to use the workflow

- In GitHub, go to Actions → “Create Feature Issues” → “Run workflow”
- Provide:
  - epic_issue: e.g., 12
  - feature_name: e.g., Player Name Input System
  - feature_path: e.g., docs/ways-of-work/plan/input-and-validation/player-name-input-system
  - priority: high
  - value: high
  - labels: frontend,validation
  - create_children: true (optional)
  - stories: one per line
  - enablers: one per line
  - tests: one per line
- Result:
  - Creates a Feature issue with labels and documentation links
  - Comments on Epic with reference
  - If `create_children=true`, creates child issues and comments on Feature and Epic with links

## Status

- Workflow added and documented
- Planning artifacts for all features already created
- Everything committed to main

If you want, I can also add a companion workflow to auto-apply project board fields/labels or set up an issue template pack that mirrors the structures in the plans.

Made changes.

## Epic Description

The project currently consists only of documentation without a runnable codebase. We need a production-ready foundation using React 18, Vite, and Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 to enable all subsequent feature development. This epic delivers a fast, mobile-first scaffold with proper tooling (ESLint, Prettier), HMR, mobile viewport configuration, and performance guardrails to keep the bundle <500KB and load times <2s on mobile.

## Business Value

- Primary Goal: Establish a modern React 18 + Vite + Tailwind v3.4.17 app scaffold optimized for mobile performance and developer productivity.
- Success Metrics (KPIs):
  - Setup time < 5 minutes
  - Dev server start < 10 seconds; HMR < 1 second
  - Production bundle < 500KB; mobile load < 2s (simulated 3G)
  - 0 linting errors; consistent formatting
- User Impact:
  - Developers can start building features immediately with reliable tooling and fast feedback.
  - Future contributors can clone, install, and run with zero-configuration friction.

## Epic Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Vite React 18 project initialized and runs via npm scripts
- [ ] Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 integrated with correct PostCSS (no v4 plugin)
- [ ] Mobile viewport meta configured; mobile-first layout baseline
- [ ] npm scripts: dev, build, preview, lint (and format if included)
- [ ] ESLint + Prettier set up for JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- [ ] HMR works; dev changes visible within ~1s
- [ ] .gitignore tailored for Node/Vite/React
- [ ] Performance guardrails documented (bundle <500KB; load <2s target)
- [ ] Documentation updated: README.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, copilot-instructions.md
- [ ] Verified on a mobile viewport (manual smoke)

## Features in this Epic

- [ ] Feature: Vite React Initialization
  - Docs: docs/ways-of-work/plan/setup-project-scaffolding/vite-react-initialization

GitHub Copilot: I’m going to harden the workflow by validating inputs (epic_issue must be a positive integer, feature_name non-empty) and adding safe error handling when commenting on the Epic; then I’ll update DEVELOPMENT.md with a troubleshooting note and commit.

Ran terminal command: cd /c/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator && git add .github/workflows/create-feature-issues.yml DEVELOPMENT.md && git commit -m "fix(actions): validate epic_issue and harden epic comment step\n\n- Validate epic_issue is a positive integer and feature_name non-empty\n- Guard and warn when commenting on Epic fails; leave breadcrumb on Feature\n- Docs: add troubleshooting note for 404 issues/0/comments scenario"

Starting (3/3) *Commit workflow and docs changes*

Thanks for the error details—this 404 is because the action tried to comment on Epic issue “0,” which doesn’t exist. That typically happens when epic_issue was left blank or entered as 0. I’ve hardened the workflow and added docs to prevent and explain this.

## What I changed
- Workflow validation
  - epic_issue must be a positive integer; empty/0 now fails fast with a clear error.
  - feature_name must be non-empty.
  - Epic comment step is now guarded: if commenting on the Epic fails (e.g., wrong issue number or missing permissions), the workflow logs a warning and posts a breadcrumb comment on the newly created Feature issue so you can link it manually.
- Documentation
  - Added a troubleshooting note in DEVELOPMENT.md explaining this exact 404 scenario and how to fix it.

If you want me to, I can commit these changes now. Then, retry the workflow with:
- epic_issue: the actual Epic issue number (for example, create an Epic issue first and use that issue number)
- feature_name: e.g., “Vite React Initialization”
- feature_path: docs/ways-of-work/plan/setup-project-scaffolding/vite-react-initialization
- create_children: true/false as needed
- stories/enablers/tests: one per line if create_children=true

Tip: To create the Epic issue itself, paste the Epic body I wrote into a new issue first. Then use that issue number as epic_issue in the workflow input.

Made changes.

GitHub Copilot: To see exactly what you changed and then commit only those files, I’ll first list the unstaged and staged changes in the repo. 

Read changed files in the active git repository

Ran terminal command: cd /c/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator && git add .github/workflows/create-feature-issues.yml && git commit -m "chore(actions): simplify Create Feature Issues workflow\n\nReduce inputs and remove child-issue automation for a leaner manual run:\n- inputs: feature_name, epic_issue\n- behavior: create Feature issue and inherit epic milestone"

Committed your simplified workflow.

What I did:
- Reviewed the current staged/unstaged changes
- Staged create-feature-issues.yml
- Commit created:
  - Hash: 296160d
  - Message: chore(actions): simplify Create Feature Issues workflow
  - Summary: 1 file changed, 17 insertions(+), 175 deletions(-)

The workflow now:
- Inputs: feature_name, epic_issue
- Behavior: creates a Feature issue and inherits the epic’s milestone

If you want to re-add optional docs links or child issue creation later, we can layer that back in behind simple flags to keep it ergonomic.

lem0n4id: can the github actions add the links to the 4 files PRD.md, implementation-plan.md, project-plan.md, issues-checklist.md if the docs link is given as an input?

Completed (4/4) *Commit workflow and doc updates*

Yes—I've enhanced the workflow to accept an optional docs_path and auto-insert links to the four docs in the Feature issue.

What I changed:
- Workflow enhancement:
  - New optional input: docs_path (e.g., docs/ways-of-work/plan/setup-project-scaffolding/vite-react-initialization)
  - When provided, the workflow lists that directory, finds PRD.md, implementation-plan.md, project-plan.md, and issues-checklist.md (case-insensitive), and adds a Docs section with links in the created Feature issue.
  - If any file is missing, the issue notes that it wasn’t found.
  - It still inherits the Epic milestone when possible.

- Documentation updates:
  - Updated copilot-instructions.md and DEVELOPMENT.md to document the new input and behavior.

How to use it:
- Run Actions → Create Feature Issues with:
  - feature_name: Vite React Initialization
  - epic_issue: <valid epic issue number>
  - docs_path: docs/ways-of-work/plan/setup-project-scaffolding/vite-react-initialization

Current status:
- Files changed:
  - create-feature-issues.yml
  - copilot-instructions.md
  - DEVELOPMENT.md
- Commit created: chore(actions,docs): add docs_path to Create Feature Issues workflow
- All todos for this enhancement are complete.

Notes:
- Case-insensitive matching is handled; links point to the repository’s default branch.
- If docs_path is invalid or unreadable, the issue will include a note and continue without blocking.

Made changes.

lem0n4id: take inpirtaion form #file:prompts and create a prompt file that when used will Generate Epic/Feature/Story issue bodies from these plans.

output format for epic:

I’ll draft a complete Epic issue body for “Setup & Project Scaffolding” that you can paste directly into a GitHub issue.

Made changes.

lem0n4id: modify #file:generate-issue-bodies.prompt.md to take only the input of epic file or feature file from the user

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
I’ll streamline the prompt so it only needs a single input: the full Markdown of either an Epic PRD or a Feature PRD, and it will auto-detect which issue body to generate.

What changed:
- Simplified inputs:
  - Now takes only one input: the full doc content (epic.md or prd.md).
  - Auto-detects Epic vs Feature based on headings/sections.
- Removed story mode and all multi-parameter inputs (names, paths, arrays).
- Adjusted templates:
  - Epic template: unchanged in structure; references use placeholders instead of URLs.
  - Feature template: references section now lists referenced files without URLs unless present in the doc.
  - “Automation” section notes docs_path as optional for the action.
- Kept the strict, paste-ready output format.

File updated:
- generate-issue-bodies.prompt.md

How to use:
- Provide the full content of the Epic or Feature PRD as the only input (doc_content).
- The prompt will detect the type and output a ready-to-paste GitHub issue body with the required sections and checklists.

If you want, I can also wire a tiny helper script to read epic.md/prd.md and feed it to this prompt, but this is optional.

Made changes.

lem0n4id: in the same path, look for prd.md implentation-plan.md project-plan.md and issues-checklist.md

Great idea—I've updated the prompt so it only needs a single input: a file_path to either epic.md or PRD.md, and it will look for the sibling docs in the same directory.

What I changed:
- Prompt behavior:
  - Input: file_path to epic.md or PRD.md.
  - Auto-detects whether it’s an Epic or Feature based on headings/sections.
  - Scans the same directory (case-insensitive) for:
    - PRD.md
    - implementation-plan.md
    - project-plan.md
    - issues-checklist.md
  - References section uses repo-relative paths like <dir>/<file>, or “not found in <dir>” if missing.
  - Defaults to Feature if ambiguous.

- Files updated:
  - generate-issue-bodies.prompt.md — Simplified inputs, added sibling-scan instructions, updated templates to use file_path and dir with exists checks.
  - copilot-instructions.md — Documented the new prompt input and behavior.
  - DEVELOPMENT.md — Updated prompt library notes to reflect file_path-only usage and sibling scan.

  - Message: docs(prompts): simplify generate-issue-bodies input - accept only file_path and scan sibling docs
  - Files changed: 3

Usage:
- Provide file_path to either:
  - epic.md (for an Epic), or
  - PRD.md (for a Feature)
- The prompt will generate a paste-ready GitHub issue body and include references to PRD/implementation-plan/project-plan/issues-checklist when they exist alongside that file.

If you want, I can add a tiny script later to run this prompt given a path and print the issue body to stdout.

Made changes.

# Feature: Vite React Project Initialization

## Feature Description

Initialize a clean, production-ready React 18 project using Vite. Provide a minimal application shell (functional components + Hooks) with a sensible src/ structure, working dev server with HMR, and npm scripts (dev, build, preview). This scaffolding enables all subsequent features to be developed quickly and consistently.

## Business Value

- Outcome: A modern React 18 + Vite foundation that unblocks all feature development and standardizes project structure and tooling.
- KPIs / Signals:
  - Dev server start time < 10 seconds
  - HMR reflects changes in < 1 second
  - Initial production bundle < 100KB (pre-feature state)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Vite React 18 project scaffold created; Vite config includes React plugin; package.json has dev/build/preview; .gitignore present
- [ ] npm install succeeds; npm run dev starts; HMR works; server startup < 10s
- [ ] App.jsx renders a functional React component with no console errors
- [ ] npm run build and preview succeed; initial bundle < 100KB

## Subtasks (suggested)

- [ ] Implementation per plan (see links below)
- [ ] Tests (happy path + 1–2 edge cases)
- [ ] Docs updated (README.md/DEVELOPMENT.md/copilot-instructions.md)

## Dependencies

- None (foundation setup)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Meets acceptance criteria
- [ ] Passes lint/build/preview smoke
- [ ] Performance impact considered
- [ ] Documentation updated

- Epic: Setup & Project Scaffolding

lem0n4id: modify the prompt #file:generate-issue-bodies.prompt.md so that in references, the actual path of the files are mentioned in string in () and also in the parent subhearding keep placeholder to update the github epic issue number using #<add issue number here>

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the prompt to wrap all reference paths in parentheses and add a placeholder for the Epic issue number in the Parent section of the Feature template. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
I’ll make the prompt output more actionable by showing the exact file paths in parentheses in the References, and add an epic-issue placeholder in the Parent section.

What changed in generate-issue-bodies.prompt.md:
- References section:
  - All paths are now wrapped in parentheses. Examples:
    - Epic template:
      - Epic PRD: ({{file_path}})
      - Architecture: ({{dir}}/arch.md) (or: not found in {{dir}})
      - Sibling docs all shown as ({{dir}}/...)) with “not found in <dir>” preserved.
    - Feature template:
      - PRD: ({{file_path}})
      - Sibling docs all shown as ({{dir}}/...) with “not found in <dir>” preserved.
- Parent section (Feature template):
  - Now shows a placeholder to update the Epic GitHub issue number:
    - Epic: {{parent_epic_name}} (#<add issue number here>)

You can now generate a Feature/Epic issue body with clear, copyable relative paths and a ready-to-fill Epic issue reference number.

- Epic: Setup & Project Scaffolding (#<add issue number here>)

lem0n4id: commit #file:generate-issue-bodies.prompt.md 

GitHub Copilot: Ran terminal command: cd /c/Users/HP-LENIN/Desktop/codes/mafia-game-role-allocator && git add .github/prompts/generate-issue-bodies.prompt.md && git commit -m "docs(prompts): refine generate-issue-bodies references and epic placeholder\n\n- Wrap reference paths in parentheses and keep not-found notes\n- Add Epic issue number placeholder in Feature Parent section"

All set! I committed the updated prompt file with the refined references and epic placeholder.

Commit details:
- File: generate-issue-bodies.prompt.md
- Message: docs(prompts): refine generate-issue-bodies references and epic placeholder
- Changes:
  - Wrapped reference paths in parentheses
  - Preserved “not found in <dir>” notes
  - Added “(#<add issue number here>)” placeholder in the Feature “Parent” section

You can now use the prompt to generate paste-ready Epic/Feature issues with clear, copyable reference paths and an easy-to-fill Epic issue reference.

lem0n4id: update all files which mentions react, i want to use react 19 instead of react 18

GitHub Copilot: I’m going to scan the repository for all occurrences of “React 18” so I can update them to “React 19” consistently across docs and prompts. 

Searched text for `React 18|React v18|React18`, 36 results
