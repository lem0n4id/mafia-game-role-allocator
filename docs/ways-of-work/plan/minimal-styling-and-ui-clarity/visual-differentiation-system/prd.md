# Feature PRD: Visual Differentiation System

## 1. Feature Name

Visual Differentiation System

## 2. Epic

- **Parent Epic:** [Minimal Styling & UI Clarity](../epic.md)
- **Architecture:** [Minimal Styling & UI Clarity Architecture](../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

### Problem
Without clear visual differentiation, users struggle to understand interface elements, distinguish between different states, and navigate the application efficiently. Poor visual hierarchy leads to confusion and errors.

### Solution
Implement consistent visual styling system using Tailwind CSS utilities to create clear differentiation between cards, buttons, states, and interactive elements while maintaining minimal, lightweight design.

### Impact
- Improves interface clarity and usability
- Reduces user confusion and errors
- Creates consistent, professional appearance
- Maintains lightweight performance requirements

## 4. User Personas

### Primary: All Users
- **Role:** Anyone using the application interface
- **Context:** Need clear visual cues to navigate and interact
- **Requirements:** Obvious element differentiation, clear state indication

## 5. User Stories

- **US-22:** All cards and buttons have basic visual differentiation
- **US-23:** The layout is mobile-optimized and portrait-only

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Clear visual differentiation between cards, buttons, and content areas
- Consistent styling across all interface elements
- Mobile-optimized spacing and sizing
- Portrait-only layout optimization
- State-based styling (enabled/disabled, active/inactive)
- Accessible color contrast ratios
- Lightweight CSS using Tailwind utilities

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Minimal CSS bundle impact (<50KB additional)
- Consistent rendering across mobile browsers
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA)
- Performance impact negligible
