# Feature PRD: Error Recovery System

## 1. Feature Name

Error Recovery System

## 2. Epic

- **Parent Epic:** [Alternative & Edge Cases](../epic.md)
- **Architecture:** [Alternative & Edge Cases Architecture](../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

### Problem
Users may encounter various error scenarios like accidental double-taps, resets during reveal, or workflow interruptions. Without proper error recovery, these situations lead to broken states, confusion, or forced application restarts.

### Solution
Implement comprehensive error recovery system that handles common error scenarios gracefully, provides clear recovery paths, and maintains application stability under all user interaction patterns.

### Impact
- Prevents application crashes and broken states
- Provides smooth recovery from user errors
- Maintains workflow continuity under stress
- Improves overall application reliability and user confidence

## 4. User Personas

### Primary: All Users
- **Role:** Any user who may encounter errors or unusual interactions
- **Context:** Using application under various conditions and interaction patterns
- **Requirements:** Graceful error handling, clear recovery guidance, maintained functionality

## 5. User Stories

- **US-26:** Reset during card reveal works and returns to the input screen with names prefilled
- **US-27:** Accidental double-tap on buttons (Reveal/Close, Allocate, Reset) does not break the workflow
- **US-29:** No authentication or login is required; all users use the app from a shared device
- **US-30:** The host and players share one device sequentially; all interactions follow the same workflow

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Reset works correctly during any phase of reveal process
- Double-tap protection on all critical buttons
- Graceful handling of rapid repeated interactions
- State recovery from interrupted workflows
- Consistent behavior across all user interaction patterns
- Error states don't corrupt application data
- Clear error messages with recovery guidance
- Idempotent operations where appropriate

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Error recovery completes within 500ms
- Protection mechanisms don't impact normal operation performance
- Error handling works reliably across mobile browsers
- Recovery paths are accessible and clear to users

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Reset During Reveal
- [ ] Reset button works correctly during reveal process
- [ ] Reset clears reveal state and returns to input screen
- [ ] Names remain prefilled after reset during reveal
- [ ] No data corruption occurs during mid-reveal reset

### AC-2: Double-Tap Protection
- [ ] Rapid double-taps on Reveal button don't cause errors
- [ ] Double-tapping Close button doesn't break dialog state
- [ ] Multiple Allocate button presses are handled gracefully
- [ ] Reset button protected against accidental multiple presses

### AC-3: Workflow Continuity
- [ ] Interrupted workflows can be resumed or restarted cleanly
- [ ] State transitions are atomic and don't leave partial states
- [ ] Error conditions provide clear path back to stable state
- [ ] Application remains usable after any error scenario

### AC-4: Shared Device Workflow
- [ ] Sequential device usage works reliably
- [ ] No authentication barriers impede workflow
- [ ] Consistent interaction patterns across all users
- [ ] Device passing doesn't interrupt application state

## 8. Out of Scope

- Complex error analytics or reporting
- Advanced debugging or diagnostic features
- Multi-device synchronization
- Offline error handling
- Network error recovery

## Context Template

- **Epic:** Alternative & Edge Cases - ensuring robust application behavior under all conditions
- **Feature Idea:** Error recovery system that maintains stability and provides clear recovery paths
- **Target Users:** All users who need reliable application behavior under various interaction patterns
