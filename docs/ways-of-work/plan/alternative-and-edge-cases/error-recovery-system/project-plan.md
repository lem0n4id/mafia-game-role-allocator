# Project Plan — Error Recovery System

## 1. Project Overview
- Feature Summary: Ensure idempotency and guards for rapid taps, and provide recovery paths (e.g., reset) to continue workflow if interrupted.
- Success Criteria: Double taps do not break state; actions disable while processing; reset path available.
- Milestones: Guards on key actions → Disable during processing → Reset integration.
- Risks: Deadlocks if buttons never re-enable.
