# Epic Architecture Specification: Alternative / Edge Cases

## 1. Epic Architecture Overview

This epic implements comprehensive edge case handling and interaction robustness patterns across the entire application. The architecture focuses on idempotency guards, confirmation flows for unusual configurations, and defensive programming patterns to ensure reliable behavior under stress conditions, rapid user interactions, and non-standard input scenarios.

Key properties:
- Idempotency systems preventing duplicate actions from rapid taps or network issues
- Edge case confirmation flows for boundary conditions (mafia=0, mafia=all players)
- Defensive state validation and recovery mechanisms throughout all application phases
- Single-device workflow assumptions with no authentication or persistence requirements
- Performance-maintained interaction debouncing and state guards targeting <200ms response
- Comprehensive error boundaries and graceful degradation patterns
