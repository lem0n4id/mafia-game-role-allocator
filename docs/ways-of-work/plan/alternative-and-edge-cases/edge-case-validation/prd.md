# Feature PRD: Edge Case Validation

## 1. Feature Name

Edge Case Validation

## 2. Epic

- **Parent Epic:** [Alternative & Edge Cases](../epic.md)
- **Architecture:** [Alternative & Edge Cases Architecture](../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

### Problem
Edge cases like 0 Mafia or all-Mafia games need special handling to prevent invalid configurations while still supporting unusual but valid game modes. Without proper validation, these cases cause allocation failures or poor user experience.

### Solution
Implement comprehensive edge case validation that allows unusual configurations with appropriate warnings while preventing truly invalid setups, ensuring robust application behavior across all scenarios.

### Impact
- Supports flexible game configuration including edge cases
- Prevents application failures from invalid inputs
- Provides clear guidance for unusual configurations
- Maintains application reliability across all use cases

## 4. User Personas

### Primary: Game Host
- **Role:** Person configuring game setup
- **Context:** May want to create unusual game configurations
- **Requirements:** Flexibility with appropriate guidance and warnings

## 5. User Stories

- **US-25:** The app allows Number of Mafia = 0 or equal to total players, but warns the host via confirmation
- **US-28:** Invalid inputs (blank names, Mafia â‰¥ players) block allocation until corrected

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Allow Mafia count = 0 with confirmation warning
- Allow Mafia count = total players - 1 with confirmation
- Block allocation when any names are blank
- Block allocation when Mafia count > total players
- Provide clear warnings for edge cases
- Show specific error messages for invalid inputs
- Validation integrates with allocation flow

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Validation feedback within 100ms
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Accessible validation indicators
- Works reliably across mobile browsers

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Edge Case Allowance
- [ ] Mafia count = 0 is allowed with confirmation warning
- [ ] Mafia count = total players - 1 is allowed with confirmation
- [ ] Warnings clearly explain implications of edge cases
- [ ] User can proceed after acknowledging warnings

### AC-2: Invalid Input Prevention
- [ ] Blank names prevent allocation with clear error message
- [ ] Mafia count > total players prevents allocation
- [ ] Error messages specify what needs correction
- [ ] Allocation button remains disabled until inputs valid

### AC-3: Validation Integration
- [ ] Validation works seamlessly with allocation flow
- [ ] Warnings don't block valid configurations
- [ ] Error states clear when inputs become valid
- [ ] Validation state is consistent across re-allocation

## 8. Out of Scope

- Complex game balance validation
- Advanced configuration recommendations
- Statistical analysis of edge case usage
- Custom validation rules or business logic

## Context Template

- **Epic:** Alternative & Edge Cases - handling unusual configurations robustly
- **Feature Idea:** Edge case validation that supports flexibility while preventing failures
- **Target Users:** Hosts who need flexible game configuration with appropriate guidance
