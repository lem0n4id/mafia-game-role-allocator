# Feature PRD: Player Name Input System

## 1. Feature Name

Player Name Input System

## 2. Epic

- **Parent Epic:** [Input & Validation](../epic.md)
- **Architecture:** [Input & Validation Architecture](../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

### Problem
Hosts need to collect all player names before role allocation, but without proper validation, they can submit forms with blank names, leading to incomplete or broken game setups. Players expect their names to be preserved across configuration changes and during reset flows. The interface must balance flexibility (allowing duplicate names) with reliability (preventing blank submissions).

### Solution
Implement a comprehensive player name input system that manages all name fields, validates completeness, preserves values across interface changes, and provides clear feedback about validation state. The system allows duplicate names but strictly prevents blank entries, ensuring every player has an identifier for the role reveal process.

### Impact
- Eliminates incomplete game setups caused by missing player names
- Provides consistent name preservation across configuration changes
- Reduces setup errors and restart attempts
- Ensures reliable data for role allocation and reveal processes
- Maintains flexible name entry while enforcing essential completeness

## 4. User Personas

### Primary: Game Host
- **Role:** Person entering all player names into the system
- **Context:** Needs efficient, error-free way to collect names from all participants
- **Requirements:** Fast name entry with clear validation feedback and value preservation

### Secondary: Game Players
- **Role:** Participants whose names are being entered
- **Context:** Want their names captured correctly for role reveal
- **Requirements:** Accurate name representation in the game system

## 5. User Stories

### Core Name Input Stories
- **US-5:** As a host, I can enter player names in each input field sequentially so that all participants are identified in the system
- **US-6:** As a host, the app prevents submission if any player name field is blank so that every player has an identifier
- **US-7:** As a host, the app allows duplicate names without errors so that players with similar names can still participate

### Enhanced Input Management Stories
- **US-5.1:** As a host, I want name fields to be clearly labeled so that I know which player each field represents
- **US-5.2:** As a host, I want efficient navigation between name fields so that I can enter names quickly
- **US-5.3:** As a host, I want entered names to persist when I adjust player count so that I don't lose progress
- **US-6.1:** As a host, I want clear visual indication of which fields are required so that I know what needs completion
- **US-6.2:** As a host, I want immediate feedback about blank fields so that I can correct issues before submission
- **US-7.1:** As a host, I want flexibility in name entry so that players can use nicknames, full names, or any identifier they prefer

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Individual text input field for each player (count determined by Player Count Management)
- Clear labeling for each field (Player 1, Player 2, etc. or similar)
- Real-time validation that prevents blank/empty names
- Visual indication of required fields and validation state
- Form submission blocking when any name field is empty
- Support for duplicate names across different fields
- Name value persistence across player count changes (within bounds)
- Integration with reset functionality to restore previous names
- Clear error messaging for validation failures
- Controlled input behavior with proper state management

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Name entry must be responsive with immediate feedback (<100ms)
- Interface must work efficiently on mobile devices
- Touch targets must meet 44px minimum size requirement
- Navigation between fields must be smooth and intuitive
- Validation feedback must be clear and accessible
- Component must handle 1-30 player names without performance issues
- State management must be predictable and testable
- Integration with parent form must be clean and reliable

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Name Field Generation and Management
- [ ] Name input fields are generated based on player count
- [ ] Each field is clearly labeled with player number or position
- [ ] Fields appear in logical order (Player 1, Player 2, etc.)
- [ ] Field labels are accessible and properly associated with inputs
- [ ] Touch targets meet 44px minimum size on mobile devices

### AC-2: Name Entry and Validation
- [ ] Each field accepts text input including letters, numbers, and common symbols
- [ ] Fields prevent submission when left blank or containing only whitespace
- [ ] Real-time validation provides immediate feedback on empty fields
- [ ] Error styling clearly indicates which fields need completion
- [ ] Validation errors are accessible to screen readers

### AC-3: Duplicate Name Handling
- [ ] System allows identical names in different fields without error
- [ ] No warnings or restrictions on duplicate name entry
- [ ] Duplicate names are preserved through count changes and resets
- [ ] Each field maintains its own independent value regardless of others
- [ ] Duplicate detection doesn't impact performance with many fields

### AC-4: Value Persistence and State Management
- [ ] Names persist when player count increases (existing fields retain values)
- [ ] Names in remaining fields persist when player count decreases
- [ ] Values are maintained across component re-renders
- [ ] State can be initialized with previous names (reset scenario)
- [ ] Component provides current name array to parent components

### AC-5: Form Integration and Submission Control
- [ ] Component blocks form submission when any field is empty
- [ ] Component provides validation state to parent form
- [ ] Integration works with controlled form patterns
- [ ] Submit button/allocation button reflects validation state
- [ ] Error messages guide user to specific problematic fields

### AC-6: Mobile Usability and Navigation
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works correctly between fields (tab order)
- [ ] Mobile keyboards appear appropriately for text input
- [ ] Field focus and selection work reliably on touch devices
- [ ] Scrolling to off-screen fields works smoothly
- [ ] Interface remains usable with many fields (10+ players)

### AC-7: Reset and Restoration Functionality
- [ ] Component can be reset to initial empty state
- [ ] Component can be initialized with previous name values
- [ ] Reset preserves field structure while clearing validation errors
- [ ] Restoration maintains proper field-to-name mapping
- [ ] Integration with parent reset workflow functions correctly

## 8. Out of Scope

### Explicitly Not Included
- Player count management or dynamic field generation (handled by Player Count Management)
- Mafia count validation or ratio checking (handled by Mafia Count Validation)
- Role allocation or assignment logic (handled by Role Allocation epic)
- Advanced name validation rules (profanity filters, length limits, character restrictions)
- Name suggestions or auto-completion features
- Import/export of name lists or player rosters
- Persistence across browser sessions or local storage
- Name formatting or normalization (capitalization, trimming)
- Social features like player profiles or history

### Future Considerations
- Could add name length limits for display optimization
- Could implement auto-capitalize or formatting options
- Could add quick name entry templates or presets
- Could integrate with device contacts for name suggestions
- Could add bulk name import from text or CSV
- Could implement drag-and-drop reordering of players
- Could add player avatars or additional metadata fields

### Integration Boundaries
- **Receives:** Number of fields to generate (from Player Count Management), initial name values (for reset)
- **Provides:** Array of current name values, overall validation state, specific field errors
- **Dependencies:** Player Count Management (for field count)
- **Dependents:** Role Allocation epic (receives validated names for assignment)

### Validation Scope
- **Included:** Blank/empty validation, real-time feedback, submission prevention
- **Excluded:** Advanced content validation, business rule enforcement, external integrations
- **Edge Cases:** Whitespace-only names treated as empty, very long names handled gracefully

## Context Template
