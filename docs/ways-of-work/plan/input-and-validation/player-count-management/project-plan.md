# Project Plan — Player Count Management

## 1. Project Overview
- Feature Summary: Manage dynamic player count input driving the number of name fields. Ensure state stays consistent when increasing/decreasing players.
- Success Criteria: Fields add/remove with count changes; removing fields drops values; minimum 1 player; UI remains responsive on mobile.
- Key Milestones: Count input component → Dynamic list binding → Removal behavior → Validation integration.
- Risk Assessment: Data loss on shrink; performance when adding/removing many fields quickly.
