# Feature PRD: Role Reveal Dialog

## 1. Feature Name

Role Reveal Dialog

## 2. Epic

- **Parent Epic:** [Role Display & Reveal](../epic.md)
- **Architecture:** [Role Display & Reveal Architecture](../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

### Problem
Players need a private, secure way to view their assigned roles without other players seeing. Without proper dialog management, multiple players could accidentally see each other's roles, or the reveal process could become chaotic and unreliable.

### Solution
Implement a modal dialog system that shows individual player roles privately, with clear Reveal/Close button flow that ensures only one player can view their role at a time while providing clear guidance on the reveal process.

### Impact
- Ensures role privacy during reveal process
- Provides clear, guided reveal experience
- Prevents accidental role exposure
- Creates structured reveal workflow

## 4. User Personas

### Primary: Individual Players
- **Role:** Person viewing their assigned role privately
- **Context:** Needs secure, private access to role information
- **Requirements:** Clear role display, secure viewing, obvious close action

## 5. User Stories

- **US-16:** As a player, I tap 'Reveal Role' to view my role
- **US-17:** After viewing, the 'Reveal Role' button changes to 'Close,' which I tap before passing device
- **US-18:** Roles remain visible after reveal; there is no hide-after-view option

## 6. Requirements
