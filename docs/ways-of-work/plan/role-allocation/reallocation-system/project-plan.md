# Project Plan — Re-allocation System

## 1. Project Overview
- Feature Summary: Allow users to reshuffle all roles on demand, clearing previous allocations and re-running assignment engine.
- Success Criteria: Clicking re-allocate reshuffles; previous allocation not preserved; idempotent on double-tap; UX confirmation optional.
- Milestones: Trigger → Clear state → Re-run engine → Update UI.
- Risks: Partial state leftover causing inconsistencies.
