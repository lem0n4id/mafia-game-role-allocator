# Feature PRD: Allocation Confirmation Flow

## 1. Feature Name

Allocation Confirmation Flow

## 2. Epic

- **Parent Epic:** [Role Allocation](../epic.md)
- **Architecture:** [Role Allocation Architecture](../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

### Problem
Hosts need assurance before role allocation begins, as accidental allocation can disrupt game setup and require restarts. Without confirmation, a misplaced tap can trigger role assignment when the host isn't ready, leading to confusion about whether roles are valid or need to be regenerated. The lack of a confirmation step reduces confidence in the allocation process.

### Solution
Implement a clear confirmation flow that requires deliberate host action before role allocation begins. The system presents the allocation request with context (number of players, Mafia count) and requires explicit confirmation before proceeding to randomization. This prevents accidental allocation and builds confidence in the intentional nature of role assignment.

### Impact
- Prevents accidental role allocation from misplaced taps
- Increases host confidence in intentional allocation process
- Provides opportunity to review allocation parameters before proceeding
- Reduces setup confusion and restart attempts
- Creates clear separation between input and allocation phases

## 4. User Personas

### Primary: Game Host
- **Role:** Person managing the game setup and triggering role allocation
- **Context:** Needs to confirm allocation parameters before proceeding to irreversible randomization
- **Requirements:** Clear confirmation interface and ability to cancel if needed

### Secondary: All Players
- **Role:** Game participants waiting for role assignment
- **Context:** Depend on deliberate, intentional allocation for fair game setup
- **Requirements:** Confidence that allocation is intentional and properly configured

## 5. User Stories

### Core Confirmation Stories
- **US-9:** As a host, I can click 'Allocate Roles' to start the random assignment so that roles are distributed to all players
- **US-10:** As a host, before shuffling roles, the app shows a confirmation prompt so that I can verify I'm ready to proceed

### Enhanced Confirmation Stories
- **US-9.1:** As a host, I want the 'Allocate Roles' button to be clearly visible and accessible so that I can easily trigger allocation when ready
- **US-9.2:** As a host, I want the allocation button to be disabled when inputs are invalid so that I can't proceed with incomplete setup
- **US-10.1:** As a host, I want the confirmation prompt to show allocation details so that I can verify the configuration before proceeding
- **US-10.2:** As a host, I want clear options to confirm or cancel so that I can change my mind if needed
- **US-10.3:** As a host, I want the confirmation process to be quick and non-disruptive so that it doesn't slow down game setup

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- 'Allocate Roles' button visible and accessible on input form
- Button disabled/blocked when input validation fails
- Button enabled when all inputs are valid (names complete, valid Mafia count)
- Confirmation dialog/prompt displays when allocation is triggered
- Confirmation shows key allocation parameters (player count, Mafia count)
- Clear 'Confirm' and 'Cancel' options in confirmation interface
- Confirmation triggers role assignment engine when confirmed
- Confirmation dismisses and returns to input when cancelled
- Button state management across form validation changes
- Mobile-optimized confirmation interface

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Confirmation prompt must appear within 100ms of button press
- Confirmation interface must be touch-friendly with 44px+ targets
- Confirmation must work reliably across mobile browsers
- Button state changes must provide immediate visual feedback
- Confirmation dialog must be accessible and screen reader friendly
- Interface must prevent accidental confirmation through double-tap protection
- Component must integrate cleanly with form state management
- Confirmation flow must be testable and maintainable

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Allocate Roles Button Behavior
- [ ] 'Allocate Roles' button is clearly visible on input form
- [ ] Button is disabled when any input validation fails
- [ ] Button is enabled when all inputs are valid
- [ ] Button provides immediate visual feedback when pressed
- [ ] Button meets 44px minimum touch target size
- [ ] Button integrates with form validation state

### AC-2: Confirmation Prompt Display
- [ ] Clicking enabled 'Allocate Roles' button shows confirmation prompt
- [ ] Confirmation appears within 100ms of button press
- [ ] Confirmation displays total player count
- [ ] Confirmation displays Mafia count
- [ ] Confirmation provides context about what will happen next
- [ ] Confirmation is properly styled and mobile-optimized

### AC-3: Confirmation Dialog Interaction
- [ ] Confirmation provides clear 'Confirm' and 'Cancel' options
- [ ] Confirm button triggers role assignment process
- [ ] Cancel button dismisses confirmation and returns to input state
- [ ] Confirmation can be dismissed with escape key (desktop)
- [ ] Touch targets in confirmation are 44px+ for mobile usability

- [ ] Component integrates with role assignment engine
- [ ] Component provides allocation trigger event to parent
- [ ] State changes are predictable and testable
- [ ] Integration handles error scenarios gracefully

### AC-5: Edge Case and Error Handling
- [ ] Double-tap protection prevents multiple confirmation prompts
- [ ] Confirmation handles edge cases (0 Mafia, all Mafia) with appropriate messaging
- [ ] System gracefully handles confirmation during state transitions
- [ ] Error states are communicated clearly to user
- [ ] Recovery from error states returns to stable input state

### AC-6: Mobile and Accessibility
- [ ] Confirmation works reliably on touch devices

- [ ] Focus management works correctly with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Confirmation doesn't cause layout shifts or viewport issues
- [ ] Interface remains usable across mobile screen sizes

## 8. Out of Scope

### Explicitly Not Included
- Role assignment algorithm or randomization logic (handled by Role Assignment Engine)
- Re-allocation or reshuffling functionality (handled by Re-allocation System)
- Input validation logic (handled by Input & Validation epic features)
- Role display or reveal interface (handled by Role Display & Reveal epic)
- Advanced confirmation customization or settings
- Persistence of confirmation preferences
- Analytics or tracking of confirmation behavior
- Complex modal systems or advanced UI libraries

### Future Considerations
- Could add preview of role distribution before confirmation
- Could implement confirmation preferences or quick mode
- Could add allocation summary or configuration review
- Could integrate with undo/redo functionality
- Could add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Could implement batch confirmation for multiple games

### Integration Boundaries
- **Receives:** Form validation state from Input & Validation features
- **Provides:** Allocation trigger event, confirmed allocation parameters
- **Dependencies:** Input & Validation epic (for button enable/disable state)
- **Dependents:** Role Assignment Engine (receives confirmation trigger)

### Confirmation Scope
- **Included:** Basic confirmation dialog, parameter display, confirm/cancel actions
- **Excluded:** Complex parameter modification, advanced confirmation workflows, external integrations
- **Edge Cases:** Handled through clear messaging, passed to assignment engine for processing
