# Feature PRD: Tailwind CSS Integration

## 1. Feature Name

Tailwind CSS Integration

## 2. Epic

- **Parent Epic:** [Setup & Project Scaffolding](../epic.md)
- **Architecture:** [Setup & Project Scaffolding Architecture](../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

### Problem
The React application needs a lightweight, mobile-first styling system that maintains small bundle sizes while providing consistent design utilities. Without proper CSS architecture, the application risks inconsistent styling, large CSS bundles, and poor mobile performance. The project specifically requires Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 (not v4+) for compatibility and stability.

### Solution
Integrate Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 with PostCSS and Autoprefixer, configure mobile-first breakpoints, and establish utility-first styling patterns. This provides a consistent, performant styling foundation that supports the mobile-first architecture while keeping bundle sizes minimal through CSS purging.

### Impact
- Enables consistent, mobile-optimized styling across all components
- Maintains lightweight bundle size through automatic CSS purging
- Establishes utility-first patterns for rapid UI development
- Provides mobile-first responsive design foundation

## 4. User Personas

### Primary: UI Developer
- **Role:** Developer implementing user interface components
- **Context:** Needs consistent styling utilities for rapid mobile-first development
- **Requirements:** Mobile-optimized classes, fast styling iteration, small CSS bundle

### Secondary: Mobile Users
- **Role:** End users accessing the application on mobile devices
- **Context:** Require fast-loading, properly styled mobile interface
- **Requirements:** Quick load times, proper mobile styling, responsive design

## 5. User Stories

### Setup Stories
- **US-1:** As a developer, I want Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 installed so that I can use utility classes for styling
- **US-2:** As a developer, I want PostCSS configured so that Tailwind utilities are processed correctly
- **US-3:** As a developer, I want Autoprefixer working so that CSS has proper vendor prefixes for mobile browsers
- **US-4:** As a developer, I want Tailwind configuration file so that I can customize the framework for mobile-first design

### Development Experience Stories
- **US-5:** As a developer, I want Tailwind utilities available in React components so that I can style elements quickly
- **US-6:** As a developer, I want CSS purging configured so that unused styles are removed from production builds
- **US-7:** As a developer, I want mobile-first breakpoints so that I can create responsive designs efficiently
- **US-8:** As a developer, I want Tailwind base styles so that I have consistent typography and spacing

### Performance Stories
- **US-9:** As a mobile user, I want minimal CSS bundle size so that the app loads quickly on slow connections
- **US-10:** As a developer, I want only used Tailwind classes in the final bundle so that performance remains optimal

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Install Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 (specifically not v4+ for compatibility)
- Configure PostCSS with tailwindcss and autoprefixer plugins  
- Create tailwind.config.js with mobile-first customizations
- Set up postcss.config.js with correct plugin configuration
- Create CSS entry file with @tailwind directives (base, components, utilities)
- Configure Vite to process Tailwind CSS through PostCSS
- Enable CSS purging for production builds to remove unused styles
- Configure mobile-first breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
- Set up content paths for purging to include all React component files

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- CSS bundle size must remain <50KB after purging in production
- Tailwind processing must not slow development server startup by >2 seconds
- Hot reload must work with Tailwind class changes in <1 second
- All Tailwind utilities must be available in React components
- Mobile-first breakpoints must follow industry standards (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px)
- CSS must be compatible with modern mobile browsers (iOS Safari 14+, Chrome 90+)

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Installation and Configuration
- [ ] Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 is installed (verify exact version in package.json)
- [ ] PostCSS is configured with tailwindcss and autoprefixer plugins
- [ ] tailwind.config.js exists with proper content paths for purging
- [ ] postcss.config.js is configured correctly for Vite integration
- [ ] Vite processes Tailwind CSS without errors

### AC-2: CSS Integration
- [ ] CSS entry file includes all three Tailwind directives (@tailwind base, components, utilities)
- [ ] Tailwind CSS is imported and processed in the main React application
- [ ] Tailwind base styles (normalize, typography) are applied to the application
- [ ] Development server serves Tailwind utilities without errors

### AC-3: Utility Classes Functionality
- [ ] Basic Tailwind utilities work in React components (text-red-500, bg-blue-100, etc.)
- [ ] Spacing utilities work correctly (p-4, m-2, space-x-4, etc.)
- [ ] Layout utilities function properly (flex, grid, block, etc.)
- [ ] Typography utilities are available (text-lg, font-bold, etc.)
- [ ] Color palette is accessible through utility classes

### AC-4: Mobile-First Responsive Design
- [ ] Mobile-first breakpoints are configured (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- [ ] Responsive utilities work correctly (sm:text-lg, md:flex, etc.)
- [ ] Default styles apply to mobile without breakpoint prefixes
- [ ] Breakpoint values match mobile-first design standards
- [ ] Responsive design patterns work in development and build

### AC-5: Production Optimization
- [ ] `npm run build` successfully purges unused Tailwind classes
- [ ] Production CSS bundle is <50KB
- [ ] Only used Tailwind classes appear in final CSS bundle
- [ ] CSS purging configuration includes all React component file paths
- [ ] Production build maintains all styling functionality

### AC-6: Development Experience
- [ ] Hot reload works with Tailwind class changes
- [ ] Development server starts with Tailwind integration in <12 seconds total
- [ ] No CSS-related errors appear in browser console
- [ ] Tailwind utilities are available immediately after installation
- [ ] CSS processing does not significantly slow development iteration

## 8. Out of Scope

### Explicitly Not Included
- Custom Tailwind component creation (will be done per-component as needed)
- Tailwind UI or other third-party Tailwind-based libraries
- Dark mode configuration (not required for MVP)
- Custom color palette beyond default Tailwind colors
- Advanced Tailwind features (JIT mode configuration, custom plugins)
- CSS-in-JS integration or styled-components
- Sass or Less preprocessing
- Custom fonts or typography scale modifications
- Animation or transition libraries
- CSS Reset beyond Tailwind's base styles

### Version Constraints
- **Critical:** Must use Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 exactly - do NOT upgrade to v4+
- **Reasoning:** v4+ has breaking changes that could affect project compatibility
- **Future:** Version upgrades will be evaluated separately with compatibility testing

## Context Template

- **Epic:** Setup & Project Scaffolding - establishing technical foundation with proper styling system
- **Feature Idea:** Integrate Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 with mobile-first configuration and CSS purging for optimal performance
- **Target Users:** UI developers needing consistent, performant styling utilities for mobile-first React application
