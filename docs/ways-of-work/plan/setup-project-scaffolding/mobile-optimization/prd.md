# Feature PRD: Mobile Optimization Configuration

## 1. Feature Name

Mobile Optimization Configuration

## 2. Epic

- **Parent Epic:** [Setup & Project Scaffolding](../epic.md)
- **Architecture:** [Setup & Project Scaffolding Architecture](../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

### Problem
The application targets mobile devices exclusively but needs proper viewport configuration, performance optimization, and mobile-specific settings to ensure fast loading and optimal user experience. Without mobile-first optimization from the foundation level, the app risks poor performance, incorrect scaling, and suboptimal mobile UX.

### Solution
Configure mobile viewport meta tags, optimize Vite build settings for mobile performance, establish performance budgets, and set up mobile-first development patterns. This ensures the application is optimized for mobile devices from the ground up, meeting the <2s load time and <500KB bundle requirements.

### Impact
- Ensures proper mobile rendering and scaling across devices
- Meets performance requirements for mobile networks (<2s load time)
- Establishes performance monitoring and budgets from day one
- Provides mobile-optimized development and testing workflow

## 4. User Personas

### Primary: Mobile Users
- **Role:** End users accessing the Mafia Game Role Allocator on mobile devices
- **Context:** Using various mobile devices on different network conditions
- **Requirements:** Fast loading, proper scaling, smooth interactions, works on various screen sizes

### Secondary: Mobile Developer
- **Role:** Developer building and testing the mobile application
- **Context:** Needs mobile-optimized development workflow and testing capabilities
- **Requirements:** Mobile testing setup, performance monitoring, mobile-first development patterns

## 5. User Stories

### Viewport and Scaling Stories
- **US-1:** As a mobile user, I want the app to scale correctly on my device so that elements are properly sized and readable
- **US-2:** As a mobile user, I want the app to prevent horizontal scrolling so that the interface fits my screen
- **US-3:** As a mobile user, I want proper touch target sizes so that I can interact with elements easily
- **US-4:** As a developer, I want viewport configuration so that the app renders correctly across mobile devices

### Performance Stories  
- **US-5:** As a mobile user, I want the app to load in under 2 seconds so that I don't abandon it due to slow loading
- **US-6:** As a mobile user, I want a small bundle size so that the app loads quickly even on slow connections
- **US-7:** As a developer, I want performance budgets configured so that I'm warned if bundle size grows too large
- **US-8:** As a developer, I want build optimizations so that the production bundle is as small as possible

### Development Experience Stories
- **US-9:** As a developer, I want to test on mobile devices easily so that I can validate mobile UX during development
- **US-10:** As a developer, I want mobile-first CSS patterns established so that responsive design is straightforward
- **US-11:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring so that I can track mobile performance metrics

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Configure viewport meta tag with proper mobile settings (width=device-width, initial-scale=1)
- Set up Vite build optimizations for mobile performance (code splitting, minification)
- Configure performance budgets in Vite to warn when bundle exceeds 500KB
- Establish mobile-first CSS patterns and breakpoint strategy
- Configure Vite dev server to be accessible on local network for mobile testing
- Set up mobile-specific optimizations (preload critical resources, optimize images)
- Configure browserslist for modern mobile browser support
- Establish performance monitoring patterns for development

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Production bundle must be <500KB total size
- Application must load in <2s on simulated 3G connection  
- Viewport must render correctly on screen sizes from 320px to 768px width
- Touch targets must be minimum 44px for accessibility and usability
- Build process must include mobile performance optimizations
- Development server must be accessible on mobile devices for testing
- CSS must follow mobile-first responsive design patterns

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Viewport Configuration
- [ ] index.html includes proper viewport meta tag with mobile settings

## 8. Out of Scope

### Explicitly Not Included
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features (service workers, app manifest)
- Offline functionality or caching strategies
- Advanced performance monitoring (analytics, real user monitoring)
- Mobile app packaging (Cordova, Capacitor, React Native)
- Advanced image optimization beyond basic Vite defaults
- CDN configuration or edge caching
- Advanced bundle splitting strategies
- Mobile-specific gestures or touch interactions beyond basic touch targets
- Device-specific optimizations (iOS vs Android specific code)

### Future Considerations
- PWA features can be added as separate features if needed
- Advanced performance monitoring can be integrated later
- Mobile app packaging can be considered for native app distribution
- Advanced caching and offline features can be added as requirements evolve

### Performance Targets
