# Feature PRD: Vite React Project Initialization

## 1. Feature Name

Vite React Project Initialization

## 2. Epic

- **Parent Epic:** [Setup & Project Scaffolding](../epic.md)
- **Architecture:** [Setup & Project Scaffolding Architecture](../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

### Problem
The project currently has no functional codebase, only documentation. Developers need a working React 18 application foundation with Vite build system to begin feature development. Without this core foundation, no UI components, state management, or user interactions can be implemented.

### Solution
Initialize a clean Vite-powered React 18 project with functional component architecture, proper file structure, and essential dependencies. This creates the minimal viable application shell that other features can build upon.

### Impact
- Enables immediate feature development without configuration delays
- Establishes modern React patterns (functional components + Hooks) from the start
- Provides fast development server with hot reload for rapid iteration
- Creates foundation for mobile-first architecture

## 4. User Personas

### Primary: Core Developer
- **Role:** Developer implementing the Mafia Game Role Allocator features
- **Context:** Needs a reliable React application foundation to build upon
- **Requirements:** Modern React patterns, fast development iteration, clear project structure

### Secondary: Future Contributors  
- **Role:** Developers who may contribute to the project later
- **Context:** Should understand project structure immediately upon cloning
- **Requirements:** Standard React project layout, clear component organization

## 5. User Stories

### Core Setup Stories
- **US-1:** As a developer, I want to run `npm create vite@latest` to initialize a new React project so that I have a modern build system
- **US-2:** As a developer, I want React 18 with functional components so that I can use modern React patterns and Hooks
- **US-3:** As a developer, I want a clear `src/` directory structure so that I can organize components logically
- **US-4:** As a developer, I want `npm run dev` to start a development server so that I can see changes instantly

### Development Experience Stories
- **US-5:** As a developer, I want hot module replacement working so that I can see code changes without page refresh
- **US-6:** As a developer, I want a basic App component so that I have a starting point for feature development
- **US-7:** As a developer, I want proper package.json scripts so that I can build, dev, and preview easily

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Initialize Vite project with React 18 template using `npm create vite@latest`
- Configure Vite for React with @vitejs/plugin-react
- Create basic `src/` directory structure with components/, hooks/, utils/ folders
- Implement root App.jsx component with functional component pattern
- Configure index.html with proper meta tags and React root mounting
- Set up package.json with dev, build, and preview scripts
- Install core dependencies: react, react-dom, vite
- Create basic .gitignore for Node.js/React projects

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Development server must start in <10 seconds on typical development machine
- Hot reload must reflect changes in <1 second
- Initial bundle size must be <100KB (before features added)
- Project structure must follow React community best practices
- All components must use functional components with Hooks (no class components)
- Build output must be optimized for production deployment

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Project Initialization
- [ ] `npm create vite@latest` successfully creates project with React template
- [ ] Project includes package.json with correct React 18 dependencies
- [ ] Vite configuration file exists and includes React plugin
- [ ] Git repository is initialized with appropriate .gitignore

### AC-2: Directory Structure
- [ ] `src/` directory contains: components/, hooks/, utils/, App.jsx, main.jsx
- [ ] `public/` directory exists for static assets
- [ ] Directory structure follows React community conventions
- [ ] README.md includes setup and development instructions

### AC-3: Development Server
- [ ] `npm install` completes without errors
- [ ] `npm run dev` starts development server successfully
- [ ] Development server accessible at localhost with specified port
- [ ] Hot module replacement works for React components
- [ ] Server startup time is <10 seconds

### AC-4: Basic Application
- [ ] App.jsx renders a functional React component
- [ ] Component uses React 18 features (functional components + Hooks)
- [ ] Application displays in browser without errors
- [ ] React DevTools recognize the application
- [ ] Console shows no errors or warnings in development mode

### AC-5: Build System
- [ ] `npm run build` creates production bundle successfully
- [ ] Build output is optimized and minified
- [ ] `npm run preview` serves production build locally
- [ ] Production bundle size is <100KB (initial state)
- [ ] Build process completes in <30 seconds

## 8. Out of Scope

### Explicitly Not Included
- Tailwind CSS integration (separate feature)
- ESLint and Prettier setup (separate feature) 
- Mobile viewport configuration (separate feature)
- Any UI components or styling
- Routing configuration
- State management setup
- Testing framework integration
- TypeScript configuration (project uses JavaScript only)
- Third-party component libraries
- Performance optimizations beyond default Vite settings

### Future Considerations
- Component library integration will be handled by UI features
- Advanced build optimizations will be addressed in performance features
- Testing setup will be covered in separate testing features

## Context Template

- **Epic:** Setup & Project Scaffolding - establishing technical foundation for Mafia Game Role Allocator
- **Feature Idea:** Initialize clean Vite + React 18 project with proper structure and development server
- **Target Users:** Development team needing modern React foundation for mobile-first game application
