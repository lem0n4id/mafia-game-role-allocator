# Epic Product Requirements Document: Setup & Project Scaffolding

## Epic Name

Setup & Project Scaffolding

## Goal

### Problem
The Mafia Game Role Allocator project currently exists only as documentation (PRD, README, development plans) without any functional codebase. Developers need a properly configured development environment with the correct tech stack (React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS v3.4.17) to begin implementing features. Without proper project scaffolding, development cannot proceed, and there's a risk of configuration errors that could impact mobile performance, compatibility, or development velocity.

### Solution
Establish a complete, production-ready project foundation by initializing a Vite-powered React 18 application with Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 integration, proper mobile viewport configuration, and essential development tooling. This epic creates the technical foundation that enables all subsequent feature development while ensuring mobile-first design principles and performance requirements are built-in from day one.

### Impact
- **Development Velocity:** Enables immediate feature development without configuration delays
- **Mobile Performance:** Establishes performance-optimized build pipeline targeting <2s load times and <500KB bundle size
- **Code Quality:** Implements linting, formatting, and development standards from the start
- **Technical Risk Reduction:** Eliminates configuration-related bugs and compatibility issues

## User Personas

### Primary: Development Team
- **Role:** Core developer responsible for implementing the Mafia Game Role Allocator
- **Context:** Needs a reliable, fast development environment that supports rapid iteration
- **Requirements:** Modern tooling, fast hot reload, mobile testing capabilities, consistent code formatting

### Secondary: Future Contributors
- **Role:** Potential contributors who may join the project later
- **Context:** Should be able to clone, install, and start development quickly
- **Requirements:** Clear setup instructions, standard tooling, no complex configuration

## High-Level User Journeys

### Development Environment Setup Journey
1. **Clone Repository:** Developer clones the project repository
2. **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` to install all project dependencies
3. **Start Development:** Run `npm run dev` to launch development server
4. **Mobile Testing:** Access development server on mobile device for testing
5. **Code Development:** Write code with hot reload, linting, and formatting support

### Build & Deployment Journey
1. **Production Build:** Run `npm run build` to create optimized production bundle
2. **Build Validation:** Verify bundle size meets <500KB requirement
3. **Mobile Testing:** Test production build on mobile devices
4. **Performance Validation:** Confirm <2s load time on mobile networks

## Business Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **React 18 Application:** Initialize functional component-based React 18 project with Hooks support
- **Vite Build System:** Configure Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS v3.4.17:** Integrate exact version v3.4.17 (not v4+) with mobile-optimized configuration
- **Mobile Viewport:** Configure proper viewport meta tags and responsive design foundation
- **Development Scripts:** Provide npm scripts for dev server, build, preview, and linting
- **Code Quality Tools:** Integrate ESLint and Prettier with consistent formatting rules
- **Hot Module Replacement:** Enable fast development with instant code reload
- **Git Integration:** Initialize git repository with appropriate .gitignore for Node.js/React projects

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Development server must start in <10 seconds, hot reload in <1 second
- **Bundle Size:** Production build must be <500KB to meet mobile performance targets
- **Load Time:** Production build must achieve <2s load time on 3G mobile networks
- **Browser Compatibility:** Support modern mobile browsers (iOS Safari 14+, Chrome 90+)
- **Development Experience:** Zero-configuration setup after npm install
- **Code Standards:** Enforce consistent code style with automated formatting and linting
- **Mobile-First:** All configurations optimized for mobile performance from start

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- **Setup Time:** New developer can get running development environment in <5 minutes
- **Build Performance:** Development server starts in <10 seconds
- **Bundle Size:** Production build remains <500KB (target: ~200-300KB)
- **Load Time:** Production build loads in <2s on simulated 3G connection
- **Code Quality:** 0 linting errors, consistent formatting across all files

### Development Productivity KPIs
- **Hot Reload Speed:** Code changes reflect in browser within 1 second
- **Build Success Rate:** 100% successful builds without configuration errors
- **Mobile Testing:** Development server accessible on mobile devices for testing
- **Developer Satisfaction:** Setup process requires no troubleshooting or manual configuration

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly Not Included
- **Feature Implementation:** No UI components, routing, or business logic
- **Advanced Tooling:** No testing frameworks, CI/CD, or deployment configurations
- **TypeScript:** Project uses JavaScript only, no TypeScript setup
- **UI Libraries:** No third-party component libraries (shadcn, Material-UI, etc.)
- **Backend Setup:** No server, API, or database configuration
- **Analytics Integration:** No tracking, monitoring, or analytics setup
- **Advanced CSS:** No CSS-in-JS libraries, preprocessors, or complex styling systems
- **PWA Features:** No service workers, offline capabilities, or app manifests

### Future Considerations
- Testing framework setup will be addressed in Phase 7
- Deployment configuration will be handled separately
- Performance monitoring can be added after core features are implemented

## Business Value

### Value Assessment: High

### Justification
This epic is **critical path** for all subsequent development. Without proper project scaffolding:
- **Zero feature development possible** - blocks entire project timeline
- **High risk of technical debt** - improper setup leads to refactoring costs later
- **Mobile performance issues** - incorrect configuration impacts core user experience
- **Developer productivity loss** - poor tooling slows all future development

The investment in proper scaffolding pays dividends throughout the entire development lifecycle by:
- **Enabling fast iteration** on features and user feedback
- **Preventing performance regressions** with built-in optimization
- **Reducing debugging time** with proper development tooling
- **Ensuring consistent code quality** from day one

### ROI Calculation
- **Investment:** 0.5 days development time
- **Return:** Enables 6.5 days of efficient feature development
- **Risk Mitigation:** Prevents potential 2-3 days of refactoring poor initial setup
- **Performance Impact:** Foundation for meeting mobile performance requirements critical to user adoption

## Context Template

- **Epic Idea:** Establish the complete technical foundation for the Mafia Game Role Allocator by setting up a modern React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS development environment optimized for mobile performance and developer productivity.
- **Target Users:** Development team and future contributors who need a reliable, fast, and standards-compliant development environment for building the mobile-first Mafia game application.
