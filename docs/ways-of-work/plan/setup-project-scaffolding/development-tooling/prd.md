# Feature PRD: Development Tooling Setup

## 1. Feature Name

Development Tooling Setup

## 2. Epic

- **Parent Epic:** [Setup & Project Scaffolding](../epic.md)
- **Architecture:** [Setup & Project Scaffolding Architecture](../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

### Problem
Without proper development tooling, the codebase risks inconsistent formatting, linting errors, and poor developer experience. Manual code formatting and error checking slows development velocity and can introduce bugs. The project needs automated tooling to maintain code quality and developer productivity from day one.

### Solution
Integrate ESLint for JavaScript linting, Prettier for consistent code formatting, and comprehensive npm scripts for all development workflows. Configure these tools to work together seamlessly with Vite and React, providing immediate feedback and automated code quality enforcement.

### Impact
- Ensures consistent code style across all contributors
- Catches JavaScript errors and React-specific issues early
- Automates formatting to eliminate style discussions and conflicts
- Improves developer productivity with fast feedback loops
- Establishes quality gates for future CI/CD integration

## 4. User Personas

### Primary: Core Developer
- **Role:** Developer writing and maintaining the Mafia Game Role Allocator code
- **Context:** Needs immediate feedback on code quality and consistent formatting
- **Requirements:** Fast linting, automatic formatting, clear error messages

### Secondary: Future Contributors
- **Role:** Developers contributing to the project after initial setup
- **Context:** Should follow established code standards without manual configuration
- **Requirements:** Automated code quality tools, consistent development experience

### Tertiary: Code Reviewers
- **Role:** Team members reviewing pull requests and code changes
- **Context:** Need assurance that code follows standards and best practices
- **Requirements:** Consistent formatting, automated error detection, quality enforcement

## 5. User Stories

### Linting Stories
- **US-1:** As a developer, I want ESLint configured for React so that I catch JavaScript and React errors early
- **US-2:** As a developer, I want linting to run in my editor so that I see errors immediately while coding
- **US-3:** As a developer, I want `npm run lint` to check all files so that I can validate code quality
- **US-4:** As a developer, I want React-specific linting rules so that I follow React best practices

### Formatting Stories
- **US-5:** As a developer, I want Prettier configured so that code is formatted consistently
- **US-6:** As a developer, I want automatic formatting on save so that I don't think about code style
- **US-7:** As a developer, I want `npm run format` to format all files so that I can fix formatting issues
- **US-8:** As a contributor, I want the same formatting standards applied automatically so that my code fits the project style

### Development Workflow Stories
- **US-9:** As a developer, I want comprehensive npm scripts so that I can run all development tasks easily
- **US-10:** As a developer, I want linting and formatting to work together so that they don't conflict
- **US-11:** As a developer, I want fast tool execution so that development workflow isn't slowed down

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Install and configure ESLint with React plugin and recommended rules
- Install and configure Prettier with project-specific formatting rules
- Create comprehensive npm scripts for all development tasks (lint, format, dev, build, preview)
- Configure ESLint and Prettier to work together without conflicts
- Set up .eslintrc.js with React-specific rules and best practices
- Create .prettierrc with consistent formatting configuration
- Add .eslintignore and .prettierignore for appropriate file exclusions
- Configure Vite to show ESLint errors in the development server
- Set up editor configuration files (.editorconfig) for consistent basic formatting

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Linting must complete in <5 seconds for the entire codebase
- Prettier formatting must complete in <2 seconds for the entire codebase
- Tools must not significantly slow down development server startup (<2 seconds overhead)
- ESLint rules must be appropriate for React functional components and Hooks
- Configuration must work across different editors (VS Code, WebStorm, Vim, etc.)
- Tool execution must be reliable and produce consistent results across environments

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: ESLint Configuration
- [ ] ESLint is installed with @eslint/js and eslint-plugin-react
- [ ] .eslintrc.js exists with React-specific configuration
- [ ] ESLint rules include recommended JavaScript and React best practices
- [ ] `npm run lint` successfully lints all JavaScript/JSX files
- [ ] ESLint catches common React errors (missing keys, unused variables, etc.)
- [ ] Vite development server displays ESLint errors in the browser

### AC-2: Prettier Configuration
- [ ] Prettier is installed and configured with .prettierrc
- [ ] Prettier configuration includes consistent rules (semicolons, quotes, line length)
- [ ] `npm run format` successfully formats all project files
- [ ] Prettier and ESLint configurations don't conflict
- [ ] Formatting rules are appropriate for React/JSX code

### AC-3: NPM Scripts
- [ ] `npm run dev` starts development server with hot reload
- [ ] `npm run build` creates optimized production build
- [ ] `npm run preview` serves production build for testing
- [ ] `npm run lint` runs ESLint on all relevant files
- [ ] `npm run format` runs Prettier on all relevant files
- [ ] `npm run lint:fix` automatically fixes ESLint issues where possible

### AC-4: Tool Integration
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier work together without rule conflicts
- [ ] Development server shows linting errors without crashing
- [ ] Tools execute quickly without significantly slowing development
- [ ] Configuration works consistently across different development environments
- [ ] .gitignore excludes appropriate tool-generated files

### AC-5: Code Quality Enforcement
- [ ] ESLint catches React-specific issues (Hooks rules, JSX prop validation)
- [ ] JavaScript syntax errors are caught and reported clearly
- [ ] Code formatting is consistent across all project files
- [ ] Unused variables and imports are flagged by ESLint
- [ ] React component naming and structure follow best practices

### AC-6: Editor Integration
- [ ] .editorconfig provides consistent basic formatting across editors
- [ ] ESLint integration works in popular editors (VS Code, WebStorm)
- [ ] Prettier integration works for format-on-save functionality
- [ ] Configuration files are properly recognized by development tools
- [ ] Tool execution doesn't interfere with editor performance

## 8. Out of Scope

### Explicitly Not Included
- TypeScript linting configuration (project uses JavaScript only)
- Testing framework integration (Jest, Vitest, etc.)
- Git hooks for pre-commit linting/formatting (husky, lint-staged)
- Advanced ESLint plugins beyond React (accessibility, performance)
- Custom ESLint rules or Prettier plugins
- CI/CD integration or automated quality gates
- Code coverage reporting tools
- Advanced editor-specific configurations beyond .editorconfig
- Deployment or build optimization beyond basic Vite configuration

### Future Considerations
- Pre-commit hooks can be added later for stricter quality enforcement
- Testing tool integration will be handled in testing-specific features
- CI/CD linting can be configured when deployment pipeline is established
- Advanced linting rules can be added as the codebase grows

### Tool Versions
- Use stable, well-supported versions of ESLint and Prettier
- Avoid bleeding-edge or experimental features that might cause instability
- Configuration should be compatible with standard React development practices
