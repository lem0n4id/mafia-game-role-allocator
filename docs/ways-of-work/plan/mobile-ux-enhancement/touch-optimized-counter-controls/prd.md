# Feature PRD: Touch-Optimized Counter Controls

## Feature Name

Touch-Optimized Counter Controls for Mobile UX Enhancement

## Epic

- **Parent Epic:** [Mobile UX Enhancement - Intuitive Counter Controls](../epic.md)
- **Architecture:** [Mobile UX Enhancement Technical Architecture](../arch.md)

## Goal

**Problem:** The current production application uses traditional HTML `<input type="number">` fields in the `PlayerCountManager` and `MafiaCountValidator` components, creating significant friction for mobile users. These number inputs require users to interact with small native spinner controls or trigger mobile keyboards, leading to precision challenges, accidental inputs, and overall frustration during the critical game setup phase. User testing indicates this is the primary remaining UX friction point in an otherwise smooth Input & Validation flow.

**Solution:** Replace all `<input type="number">` elements with custom touch-optimized counter controls featuring large increment/decrement buttons in a ↓ N ↑ layout. This feature will maintain all existing validation logic, state management patterns, and component interfaces while providing immediate tactile feedback, eliminating mobile keyboard dependencies, and creating an intuitive touch-first interaction paradigm.

**Impact:** Expected to improve mobile user engagement by 40%, reduce average setup time by 30%, decrease user drop-off during configuration by 25%, and achieve 98%+ first-attempt success rate for count adjustments. This enhancement will establish the application as a best-in-class mobile experience and provide reusable patterns for future numeric input requirements.

## User Personas

**Primary Persona - Mobile Game Host:**
- **Demographics:** Ages 16-45, smartphone users at social gatherings
- **Context:** Setting up Mafia games using live Vercel application during parties, meetups, casual gatherings
- **Current Pain Points:** Struggling with HTML number input spinners, accidental mobile keyboard triggers, difficulty making precise count adjustments under social pressure
- **Goals:** Lightning-fast, error-free game setup with intuitive controls that work seamlessly on touch devices
- **Success Criteria:** Can adjust player/Mafia counts in under 10 seconds without keyboard interaction

**Secondary Persona - Accessibility-Focused User:**
- **Demographics:** Users with motor difficulties, visual impairments, or coordination challenges
- **Context:** Need larger touch targets and predictable interaction patterns for successful game setup
- **Current Pain Points:** Small HTML number controls are difficult to interact with precisely, mobile keyboard is challenging to navigate
- **Goals:** Accessible, reliable controls that meet WCAG AA standards with enhanced motor accessibility
- **Success Criteria:** Can successfully adjust counts using screen readers and keyboard navigation

## User Stories

**Epic-Level User Stories:**

1. **As a Mobile Game Host**, I want to adjust player count using large, obvious touch buttons so that I can quickly set up games without struggling with tiny spinner controls or mobile keyboards.

2. **As a Mobile Game Host**, I want to adjust Mafia count using the same intuitive counter controls so that I can maintain consistent interaction patterns throughout the setup process.

3. **As an Accessibility-Focused User**, I want counter controls that work with screen readers and keyboard navigation so that I can independently set up games regardless of my motor abilities.

4. **As a Mobile Game Host**, I want immediate visual feedback when I tap increment/decrement buttons so that I can confidently make rapid adjustments without second-guessing my inputs.

5. **As a Mobile Game Host**, I want counter controls that prevent invalid inputs (like negative counts or exceeding limits) so that I can focus on game setup without worrying about validation errors.

6. **As a Mobile Game Host**, I want counter controls that preserve all existing validation messages and edge case warnings so that I maintain the same comprehensive feedback I currently receive.

7. **As a Developer/Maintainer**, I want counter controls implemented as reusable components so that future numeric inputs can leverage the same touch-optimized patterns.
