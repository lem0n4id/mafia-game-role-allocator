# Error Recovery System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive error recovery system for the Mafia Game Role Allocator as specified in Feature PRD: Error Recovery System.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All acceptance criteria verified

## What Was Implemented

### Core Components

1. **Error Boundary Component** (`src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx`)
   - React error boundary that catches JavaScript errors in component tree
   - Provides user-friendly fallback UI with recovery options
   - Automatic error classification and recovery strategies
   - Development mode debugging with full stack traces
   - Automatic retry for low-severity errors (max 3 attempts)

2. **Error Recovery Utility** (`src/utils/errorRecovery.js`)
   - Error classification by type: RUNTIME_ERROR, STATE_CORRUPTION, VALIDATION_ERROR, COMPONENT_ERROR, UNKNOWN_ERROR
   - Severity levels: LOW (auto-recoverable), MEDIUM (user-guided), HIGH (manual), CRITICAL (restart needed)
   - Recovery strategies: RETRY, RESET_STATE, RELOAD_COMPONENT, FALLBACK_UI, MANUAL_INTERVENTION
   - User-friendly error message generation
   - State validation utilities for detecting corruption
   - Recovery action implementations

3. **Debounce Utility** (`src/utils/debounce.js`)
   - Debounce function with configurable delay (default 300ms)
   - Throttle function for rate-limiting operations
   - React-compatible callback creators
   - Enhanced double-tap protection capabilities

4. **Global Error Handler** (`src/main.jsx`)
   - Catches unhandled promise rejections
   - Prevents browser default error behavior
   - Logs errors for debugging
   - Maintains application stability

### Integration

- Wrapped entire application in ErrorBoundary component in `main.jsx`
- Added global `unhandledrejection` event listener
- All existing components maintained their existing double-tap protection

## What Was Already Working

The application already had robust error recovery mechanisms:

### Existing Double-Tap Protection
1. **AllocationConfirmationFlow** - `isProcessing` state prevents multiple allocation attempts
2. **ResetButtonSystem** - `isResetting` state prevents multiple reset operations
3. **RoleRevealDialog** - Dialog state prevents multiple opens
4. **All Buttons** - Disabled states during async operations

### Existing State Management
- React's atomic state updates ensure no partial states
- Clean state transitions in all components
- Proper cleanup on reset operations

### Existing Workflow Support
- No authentication required (shared device workflow)
- Memory-only state (no persistence)
- Sequential reveal order enforcement

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### AC-1: Reset During Reveal ✅
**Requirement**: Reset button works correctly during reveal process and clears reveal state, returning to input screen with names prefilled.

**Implementation**:
- Reset button available in both Assignment Results and Card List Reveal phases
- `handleReset` function in App.jsx (lines 135-141) clears all states:
  - Clears assignment via `clearAssignment()`
  - Resets `showCardListInterface` to false
  - Resets `currentPlayerIndex` to 0
  - Closes any open dialogs via `closeDialog()`
- Player names preserved through `initialNames` prop
- Player count preserved through `initialCount` prop

**Verified**: Manual testing and code review

### AC-2: Double-Tap Protection ✅
**Requirement**: Rapid double-taps on all buttons don't cause errors or duplicate actions.

**Implementation**:
- **Allocate Button**: 
  - `isProcessing` state in AllocationConfirmationFlow (lines 24, 36-38)
  - Button disabled during processing (line 91)
  - Confirmation dialog blocked when processing (line 36)
  
- **Reveal Button**:
  - Dialog state check in RoleRevealDialog (line 94)
  - `isOpen` prevents multiple opens
  - Handler checks `isDialogOpen` in App.jsx (line 93)
  
- **Close Button**:
  - Dialog closing animation with `isClosing` state (line 13)
  - Button only available after reveal (line 224)
  - Clean state management prevents issues
  
- **Reset Button**:
  - `isResetting` state in ResetButtonSystem (lines 23, 34-36)
  - Button disabled during reset (line 93)
  - Confirmation dialog blocked when resetting (line 34)

**Verified**: Manual testing with rapid tapping (10+ times) on each button

### AC-3: Workflow Continuity ✅
**Requirement**: Interrupted workflows can be resumed or restarted cleanly; state transitions are atomic; error conditions provide clear recovery paths.

**Implementation**:
- **Error Boundary**: Catches runtime errors and displays fallback UI
  - Clear error messages generated by `generateErrorMessages()`
  - Recovery actions: "Try Again" for recoverable errors, "Refresh Page" always available
  - Automatic retry for LOW severity errors
  
- **Atomic State Transitions**: React's `setState` ensures atomic updates
  - All state updates use proper React patterns
  - No direct state mutations
  - Async operations use try-catch blocks
  
- **Clean State Management**:
  - Reset clears all game state while preserving input data
  - Re-allocation clears reveal states automatically
  - Dialog close handlers properly clean up state
  
- **State Validation**: `validateApplicationState()` utility available
  - Checks player array validity
  - Validates individual player properties (id, name, role)
  - Returns detailed issues list for debugging

**Verified**: Code review of all state transitions and error handling

### AC-4: Shared Device Workflow ✅
**Requirement**: Sequential device usage works reliably with no authentication barriers; consistent interaction patterns; device passing doesn't interrupt state.

**Implementation**:
- **No Authentication**: Application has no login or authentication system
- **Memory-Only State**: All state stored in React hooks (no localStorage, no backend)
- **Single Session**: All state lives in memory for single session
- **Sequential Workflow**: 
  - Strict reveal order enforced (lines 96-99 in App.jsx)
  - Current player indicator always visible (sticky positioning)
  - Progress tracking shows completion status
  
- **Device Passing Friendly**:
  - No user-specific state or sessions
  - Same interface for all users
  - No need to "log in" or "switch users"
  - Dialog close returns focus to next action

**Verified**: Design review - no authentication system exists, all state is ephemeral
